abstract = {Many of the popular building energy simulation programs around the world are reaching maturity — some use simulation methods (and even code) that originated in the 1960s. For more than two decades, the US government supported development of two hourly building energy simulation programs, BLAST and DOE-2. Designed in the days of mainframe computers, expanding their capabilities further has become difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. At the same time, the 30 years have seen significant advances in analysis and computational methods and power — providing an opportunity for significant improvement in these tools. In 1996, a US federal agency began developing a new building energy simulation tool, EnergyPlus, building on development experience with two existing programs: DOE-2 and BLAST. EnergyPlus includes a number of innovative simulation features — such as variable time steps, user-configurable modular systems that are integrated with a heat and mass balance-based zone simulation — and input and output data structures tailored to facilitate third party module and interface development. Other planned simulation capabilities include multizone airflow, and electric power and solar thermal and photovoltaic simulation. Beta testing of EnergyPlus began in late 1999 and the first release is scheduled for early 2001.},

abstract = {Existing dynamic energy simulation tools exceed the static dimension of the simplified methods through a better and more accurate prediction of energy use; however, their ability to predict real energy consumption is undermined by a weak representation of human interactions with the control of the indoor environment. The traditional approach to building dynamic simulation considers energy consumption as fully deterministic, taking into account standardized input parameters and using fixed and unrealistic schedules (lighting level, occupancy, ventilation rate, thermostat set-point). In contrast, in everyday practice occupants interact with the building plant system and building envelope in order to achieve desired indoor environmental conditions. In this study, occupant behavior in residential building was modelled accordingly to a probabilistic approach. A new methodology was developed to combine probabilistic user profiles for both window opening and thermostat set-point adjustments into one building energy model implemented in the dynamic simulation tool IDA Ice. The aim of the study was to compare mean values of the probabilistic distribution of the obtained results with a singular heating energy consumption value obtained by means of standard deterministic simulations. Major findings of this research demonstrated the weakness of standardized occupant behavior profile in energy simulation tools and the strengths of energy models based on measurements in fields and probabilistic modelling providing scenarios of occupant behavior in buildings. {\textcopyright} 2014 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Excess mortality has been noted during high ambient temperature episodes. During such episodes, individuals are not likely to be uniformly exposed to temperatures within cities. Exposure of individuals to high temperatures is likely to fluctuate with the micro-urban variation of outdoor temperatures (heat island effect) and with factors linked to building properties. In this paper, a GIS-based regression mapping approach is proposed to model urban spatial patterns of indoor temperatures in time, for all residential buildings of an urban area. In July 2005, the hourly indoor temperature was measured with data loggers for 31 consecutive days, concurrently in 75 dwellings in Montreal. The general estimating equation model (GEE) developed to predict indoor temperatures integrates temporal variability of outdoor temperatures (and their 24 h moving average), with geo-referenced determinants available for the entire city, such as surface temperatures at each site (from a satellite image) and building characteristics (from the Montreal Property Assessment database). The proportion of the variability of the indoor temperatures explained increases from 20{\%}, using only outdoor temperatures, to 54{\%} with the full model. Using this model, high-resolution maps of indoor temperatures can be provided across an entire urban area. The model developed adds a temporal dimension to similar regression mapping approaches used to estimate exposure for population health studies, based on spatial predictors, and can thus be used to predict exposure to indoor temperatures under various outdoor temperature scenarios. It is thus concluded that such a model might be used as a means of mapping indoor temperatures either to inform urban planning and housing strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change, to orient public health interventions, or as a basis for assessing exposure as part of epidemiological studies.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel data mining framework for the exploration and extraction of actionable knowledge from data generated by electricity meters. Although a rich source of information for energy consumption analysis, electricity meters produce a voluminous, fast-paced, transient stream of data that conventional approaches are unable to address entirely. In order to overcome these issues, it is important for a data mining framework to incorporate functionality for interim summarization and incremental analysis using intelligent techniques. The proposed Incremental Summarization and Pattern Characterization (ISPC) framework demonstrates this capability. Stream data is structured in a data warehouse based on key dimensions enabling rapid interim summarization. Independently, the IPCL algorithm incrementally characterizes patterns in stream data and correlates these across time. Eventually, characterized patterns are consolidated with interim summarization to facilitate an overall analysis and prediction of energy consumption trends. Results of experiments conducted using the actual data from electricity meters confirm applicability of the ISPC framework.},

abstract = {Nowadays, buildings are increasingly expected to meet higher and more complex performance requirements. Among these requirements, energy efficiency is recognized as an international goal to promote energy sustainability of the planet. Different approaches have been adopted to address this goal, the most recent relating consumption patterns with human occupancy. In this work, we analyze what are the main parameters that should be considered to be included in any building energy management. The goal of this analysis is to help designers to select the most relevant parameters to control the energy consumption of buildings according to their context, selecting them as input data of the management system. Following this approach, we select three reference smart buildings with different contexts, and where our automation platform for energy monitoring is deployed. We carry out some experiments in these buildings to demonstrate the influence of the parameters identified as relevant in the energy consumption of the buildings. Then, in two of these buildings are applied different control strategies to save electrical energy. We describe the experiments performed and analyze the results. The first stages of this evaluation have already resulted in energy savings of about 23{\%} in a real scenario.},

abstract = {Two statistical modelling techniques, generalized additive models (GAM) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), were used to analyse relationships between the distributions of 15 freshwater fish species and their environment. GAM and MARS models were fitted individually for each species, and a MARS multiresponse model was fitted in which the distributions of all species were analysed simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using changes in deviance in the fitted models and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calculated using a bootstrap assessment procedure that simulates predictive performance for independent data. Results indicate little difference between the performance of GAM and MARS models, even when MARS models included interaction terms between predictor variables. Results from MARS models are much more easily incorporated into other analyses than those from GAM models. The strong performance of a MARS multiresponse model, particularly for species of low prevalence, suggests that it may have distinct advantages for the analysis of large datasets. Its identification of a parsimonious set of environmental correlates of community composition, coupled with its ability to robustly model species distributions in relation to those variables, can be seen as converging strongly with the purposes of traditional ordination techniques. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To provide designers objective information on the risks and benefits of this technology, this study offers data from simulations, laboratory tests, and a 2.5-year field test of prototype large-area eletrochromic windows evaluated under outdoor sun and sky conditions. The study characterized the prototypes in terms of transmittance range, coloring uniformity, switching speed, and control accuracy. It also integrated the windows with a daylighting control system and then used sensors and algorithms to balance energy efficiency and visual comfort, demonstrating the importance of intelligent design and control strategies to provide the best performance. Compared to an efficient low-e window with the same daylighting control system, the electrochromic window showed annual peak cooling load reductions from control of solar heat gains of 19–26{\%} and lighting energy use savings of 48–67{\%} when controlled for visual comfort. Subjects strongly preferred the electrochomic window over the reference window, with preferences related to perceived reductions in glare, reflections on the computer monitor, and window luminance. The EC windows provide provided the benefit of greater access to view year-round. Though not definitive, findings can be of great value to building professionals.},

Nonetheless, most regulations and instruments are still aimed at achieving sustainable newly built construction. An evidenced-based overview of the current state of the residential building stock is provided for eight northern European countries along with current renovation data. Comparisons are made on the characteristics, physical quality and developments of the residential building stock. Existing policies and incentives to reduce energy use and CO2 emissions are analysed for their impacts on the existing building stock as well as the barriers preventing successful sustainable renovation. Common denominators in the current state of renovation of residential building stock are used to identify possible future instruments and incentives that are needed to overcome current barriers.},

These data were then used to drive the Home Energy Saver model to simulate current energy consumption and expected energy savings from a combination of three weatherization treatments: replacing a standard thermostat with a programmable thermostat, installing attic insulation, and envelope air sealing. Modeled energy savings were compared to observed energy savings. Results show that greater energy saving potential generally exists in cities with colder climates, but the effectiveness of different weatherization treatments also varies with differences in regional housing stock and space conditioning equipment.

abstract = {This study determines the effects of building openings, size, proportions, orientation, and latitude with regard to the needed energy to keep interior spaces within the comfort zone. For this analysis, the average temperatures throughout the year and average daily temperature swings at five different locations are applied, indicating the effect of exposure to morning direct radiation, which is considered early solar energy, versus noon and afternoon, and the potential energy gain from optimized orientation of buildings. Data such as temperature values are assigned to the anticipated average based on collected data. Depending on latitude and local climate, it is evident that minor angle shifts in building orientation may produce noticeable results in terms of energy gain or block at different times of the day. Adjustments on proportions and azimuth contribute toward a rate of solar energy gain that corresponds better to the building needs for thermal energy at different times of the day.

abstract = {Whether you are a statistician, engineer, or businessperson, you need statistics. You want to be able to easily reference tables, find formulas, and know how to use them so you can extract information from data without getting bogged down by advanced statistical methods. Your goal is to determine the appropriate statistical procedures and interpret the results. Standard Probability and Statistics: Tables and Formulae provides the tools you need to do just that. Logically organized and reaching far beyond a mere catalog, a textual description accompanies each entry- most include an example. The topics addressed are directly applicable to modern business and engineering as well as to statistics, including regression analysis, ANOVA, decision theory, signal processing, and control theory. The result is an accessible, example-oriented handbook that supplies the basic principles, the most commonly used values, and the information to make them work for you. It is easy to fill a statistics reference with hundreds of pages of tables - sometimes for just one test. This handbook is much more. With topics ranging from classical statistics to modern applications, Standard Probability and Statistics fills the need for an up-to-date, authoritative statistics reference.},

Accurate load forecasting supports power companies to make unit commitment decisions and schedule maintenance plans appropriately. In addition to minimizing the power generation costs, it is also important for the reliability of energy systems. This research study presents the implementation of a novel fuzzy wavelet neural network model on an hourly basis, and validates its performance on the prediction of electricity consumption of the power system of the Greek Island of Crete. In the proposed framework, a multiplication wavelet neural network has replaced the classic linear model, which usually appears in the consequent part of a neurofuzzy scheme, while subtractive clustering with the aid of the Expectation–Maximization algorithm is being utilized in the definition of fuzzy rules. The results related to the minimum and maximum load using metered data obtained from the power system of the Greek Island of Crete indicate that the proposed forecasting model provides significantly better forecasts, compared to conventional neural networks models applied on the same dataset.},

As it was initially developed for the study of dynamical systems, and was later used in nonlinear time series analysis, the question of using it as a signal processing tool has not been put into discussion yet. In this field the projective techniques are largely used, with good results. Nevertheless, they also have some limitations {\&}{\#}x2014; especially regarding transient signal processing. But this kind of signals are ubiquitous in real world. In addition, propagation through various media as well as on multiple paths lead to delayed, attenuated and dilated versions of the original transients.

abstract = {This paper describes a novel method for detecting abnormal energy consumption in buildings based on daily readings of energy consumption and peak energy consumption. The method uses outlier detection to determine if the energy consumption for a particular day is significantly different than previous energy consumption. For buildings with abnormal energy consumption, the amount of variation from normal is determined using robust estimates of the mean and standard deviation. This new data analysis method will reduce operating costs by detecting problems that previously would have gone unnoticed. Also, operators should save time by not having to manually detect faults or diagnose false alarms. The new data analysis method has successfully detected high-energy consumption in many buildings. This paper presents field test results for buildings that had the following problems: (1) chiller failure and a poor control strategy, (2) poor design of ventilating and air-conditioning equipment, and (3) improper operation of equipment following a change in the electrical panel.},

abstract = {This study examines the change in the space heating energy consumption and its associated cost and carbon emissions following retrofit energy efficiency upgrade. 3 to 4 week fuel consumption and temperature data were collected from some 1500 dwellings over two successive winters in 2001/2002 and 2002/2003. The case study dwellings were occupied by elderly householders or families with young children and were either awaiting or had received a combination of draught proofing, insulation and central heating measures under England's Warm Front Scheme. The findings show that the Warm Front Scheme resulted in a mean increase of 1.6 °C in indoor temperature and a mean increase of 12 {\%} in fuel consumption. Nevertheless, the switch from electricity to gas for space heating following the introduction of gas boilers resulted in a mean reduction in heating cost by 7 {\%}. The scheme was found to have negligible impact on carbon emissions. Characteristic differences were observed with individual energy efficiency measures. Central heating resulted in the greatest temperature rise by 2.3 °C followed by insulation by 0.7 °C with a negligible impact from draught proofing. Clear evidence was found in householders increasing the demand temperature following the introduction of a central heating system while no evidence of this was found following the introduction of insulation. In terms of energy use, insulation resulted in a mean saving of 9 {\%} but fell short by 74 {\%} to 84 {\%} from the theoretical prediction while central heating resulted in a mean increase of 29 {\%} in the energy consumption. Draught proofing was found to have little impact on the energy use. When examined in terms of energy cost, insulation and central heating all resulted in mean cost savings of 13 {\%} and 9 {\%} respectively but falling short by 55 {\%} to 72 {\%} and 57 {\%} to 82 {\%} compared to their respective theoretically predicted mean cost savings. Insulation also resulted in mean carbon emissions saving of 13 {\%} but fell short by 56 {\%} to 73 {\%} from the theoretical prediction while central heating resulted in insignificant carbon emissions saving. Combining insulation with central heating was found to be beneficial in terms of mitigating the energy consumption rise associated with central heating from 29 {\%} down to 16 {\%} while maximizing the temperature gain by as much as 3.1 °C.},

@article{Stamp2013a,
abstract = {The so-called performance gap between designed and as-built building performance threatens to undermine carbon reduction strategies in the built environment. Field measurements to date have indicated that the measured as-built fabric heat loss of tested UK buildings is consistently higher than design values, often considerably so. Currently, our lack of knowledge over the extent of this gap, and the processes that cause it, is compounded by a lack of robust post-construction evaluation tools. Much of this post-construction evaluation work is based, in part, on the use of co-heating tests: a method utilising an energy balance to determine the heat loss across the entire building envelope, defined by the heat loss coefficient (W/K). However, the errors associated with co-heating are not well understood or typically addressed in the literature. Furthermore, the test procedure requires a building to be unoccupied for two to three weeks and is therefore often cited as costly and unsuitable both for developers and as a policy tool. In order to improve the application of this test method it is crucial firstly to understand the sources of uncertainty in co-heating tests and the ‘steady-state' energy balance they are based upon. With a small database of tests performed to date it is difficult to discern these sources of error. This paper presents the results of a method using simulated co-heating tests to show how key weather variables influence the co-heating result. In particular the effects of short-wave solar and long-wave sky radiation are presented. Improvements to the co-heating method can be derived from this; in particular the need to consider when dwellings should be tested to avoid large solar-generated errors and the importance of an accurately calculated solar aperture. Recommendations also include the local measurement of sky radiation to avoid outlying data points, bias in the measurement and discrepancies when comparing design and as-built heat loss.},

abstract = {Traditional approaches to understand the problem of the energy performance in the domestic sector include on-site surveys by energy assessors and the installation of complex home energy monitoring systems. The time and money that needs to be invested by the occupants and the form of feedback generated by these approaches often makes them unattractive to householders. This paper demonstrates a simple, low cost method that generates thermal diagnostics for dwellings, measuring only one field dataset; internal temperature over a period of 1week. A thermal model, which is essentially a learning algorithm, generates a set of thermal diagnostics about the primary heating system, the occupants' preferences and the impact of certain interventions, such as lowering the thermostat set-point. A simple clustering approach is also proposed to categorise homes according to their building fabric thermal performance and occupants' energy efficiency with respect to ventilation. The advantage of this clustering approach is that the occupants receive tailored advice on certain actions that if taken will improve the overall thermal performance of a dwelling. Due to the method's low cost and simplicity it could facilitate government initiatives, such as the ‘Green Deal' in the UK.},

That is, the accuracy of audit predictions of energy savings for recommended retrofit measures is generally unknown. Data available from a recent evaluation of the Bonneville Power Administration Residential Weatherization Pilot Program allow comparison and analysis of the relationships between actual electricity savings and audit estimates of likely savings. The BPA program offered free home energy audits to identify cost-effective conservation measures to reduce space and water heating electricity use. The program also offered zero-interest, deferred-payment loans for installation of measures recommended during the audit. The actual reduction in annual electricity use averaged 4130 kWh across participant households. The cost of the retrofits that yielded this saving averaged {\$}2100. The median ratio of actual-to-estimated saving is 0.66. Thus, on average, two thirds of the expected saving is actually realized. However, there is substantial variation in this ratio. Actual electricity use increases in the second year for more than 10{\%} of these homes. On the other hand, actual savings are more than double the audit estimates in more than 10{\%} of the homes.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simulation study of three dynamic electrochromic window glazings, including a novel glazing capable of independently modulating its optical properties in both the visible and near-infrared spectrums. This capability allows this so-called “dual-band” technology to actively manage the solar heat and visible light transmitted into a building's interior, and creates the potential for heating, cooling, and lighting savings vis-{\`{a}}-vis competing window technologies. In this study EnergyPlus is used to simulate annual energy performance of the dual-band electrochromic (DBEC) glazing in three building types and 16 U.S. climate regions. The savings potential of DBEC windows are presented relative to a conventional electrochromic glazing; a visibly transparent, near-infrared switching electrochromic glazings; and several static alternatives, including ASHRAE 90-2010 standard compliant windows. Results indicate that the DBEC glazings are capable of outperforming alternatives in a diverse set of locations and building types, including both heating and cooling-dominated regions. Relative to code-compliant static windows, the DBEC is capable of achieving annual primary energy savings between 6 and 30kWh/ft2 of window area from reduced heating, cooling, and lighting demand. Relative to other advanced glazings, the savings are significantly lower, ranging from 0 to 1.2kWh/ft2. Regional DBEC energy cost savings versus high performance static windows are presented to identify early potential market entries based on energy savings. Finally, the impacts of widespread deployment of high-efficiency LED lighting on DBEC energy savings potentials are also presented.},

abstract = {Indoor temperatures during winter conditions play an important role in influencing: the health of households, space heating energy demand and peak heating power. How physical dwelling features and household characteristics affect wintertime indoor temperatures has been examined among low-income households, but not across English households in a systematic manner. In this paper there was a particular focus on whether older dwellings are colder and how temperature conditions vary with household socio-economic conditions. Using a cross-sectional survey of English dwellings that included monitoring of indoor temperatures from January 2011 to February 2012, this study examines the determinants of indoor temperatures during wintertime conditions within a representative sample of English dwellings (N=821). The study analysed indoor temperatures standardised to outdoor wintertime conditions of 0 °C, 5 °C and 10 °C within the study sample and the influence of physical dwelling features (type, age, size), household characteristics (tenure, income, composition, benefit receipt) and energy performance (loft and wall insulation, heating system and performance rating levels). The analysis finds that as dwelling age increased, so did indoor temperatures in both the living room and bedrooms, after adjusting for a selection of dwelling and household characteristics. Compared to the lowest income quintile, households with higher incomes kept warmer temperatures, but this was not a linear increase and the highest incomes were not on average the warmest. However, there appears to be little change in these trends when looking at lower or higher outdoor temperature conditions (i.e. 0 °C and 10 °C). In designing policies to improve indoor thermal conditions, policymakers will need to consider underlying energy performance of the dwelling alongside the socio-economic conditions of the household.},

Gibson, one of the founders of this movement, made room for this concept by arguing against the mechanistic conceptions in psychology. In his view, the environment is not a collection of causes that pushes the animal around, but consist of action possibilities, which he coined affordances. In making their way in the world, animals regulate their behavior with respect to these possibilities. Reed later developed this ecological conception of agency, following Gibson in conceiving of affordances as action possibilities. However, drawing upon industrial design, architecture, and phenomenology, we argue that affordances are not mere action possibilities but that they can also invite behavior. We suggest a mutualist perspective on invitations, suggesting that they depend on the animal–environment relationship in multiple dimensions. The implications of this new conception of affordances for the ecological account of agency are explored.},

abstract = {The recent ASHRAE project, “Updating the ASHRAE/ ACCA Residential Heating and Cooling Load Calculation Procedures and Data” (1199-RP), developed two new resi- dential load calculation procedures: residential heat balance (RHB), a detailed heat balance method that requires computer implementation, and residential load factor (RLF), a simpli- fied procedure that is hand tractable and suitable for spread- sheet implementation. This paper describes RHB and its development. For calculation of sensible cooling load, RHB applies the general approach of the ASHRAE heat balance (HB) method, based on room-by-room 24-hour design-day simulation. The 24-hour procedure eliminates issues of gain diversity that are troublesome in prior single-condition meth- ods. RHB includes algorithms for calculating sensible cooling loads with temperature swing (temperature excursion above the cooling setpoint) and to handle master/slave control (room cooling controlled by a thermostat in another room). RHB is implemented in the ResHB FORTRAN 95 application, devel- oped by modification and extension of the ASHRAE Loads Toolkit. The paper documents RHB/ResHB models and model- ing assumptions. Because RHB is a first-principles heat balance procedure, it can be directly validated and refined using empirical data. INTRODUCTION},

Four different occupancy profiles were simulated over the period of one year using the time step of one hour. Four different thermal comfort strategies for different occupancy profiles were analysed as well. Simulation results clearly show that age, behaviour and number of occupants have to be taken into account when performing building energy simulations, especially for energy efficient houses. Results show that assumptions concerning the characteristics and behaviour of occupants play an important role in performing simulations of energy efficient residential houses. Therefore, it is recommended to collect as much as possible information on the occupants and their preferences, and avoid using preset occupancy profiles if more accurate data is available.},

abstract = {A statement of measurement uncertainty is indispensable in judging the fitness for purpose of a measured quantity value. At the greengrocery store the customer would be content if, when buying a kilogram of fruit, the scales gave a value within, say, 2 grams of the fruit's actual weight. However, the dimensions of components of the gyroscopes within the inertial navigation systems of commercial aircraft are checked by measurement to parts in a million for correct functioning. Measurement uncertainty is a general concept associated with any measurement and can be used in professional decision processes as well as judging attributes in many domains, both theoretical and experimental. As the tolerances applied in industrial production become more demanding, the role of measurement uncertainty becomes more important when assessing conformity to these tolerances. Measurement uncertainty plays a central role in quality assessment and quality standards. Measurement is present in almost every human activity, including but not limited to industrial, commercial, scientific, healthcare, safety and environmental. Measurement helps the decision process in all these activities. Measurement uncertainty enables users of a measured quantity value to make comparisons, in the context of conformity assessment, to obtain the probability of making an incorrect decision based on the measurement, and to manage the consequential risks. This document serves as an introduction to measurement uncertainty, the GUM and the related documents indicated in the Foreword. A probabilistic basis for uncertainty evaluation is used. Annex A gives acronyms and initialisms used in this document. In future editions of JCGM 200 (VIM) it is intended to make a clear distinction between the use of the term error as a quantity and as a quantity value. The same statement applies to the term indication. In the current document such a distinction is made. JCGM 200:2008 does not distinguish explicitly between these uses.},

abstract = {Smart glass is such that its properties may be changed by application of a potential across it. The change in properties may be engineered to alter the amount of heat energy that can penetrate the glass which provides heating and cooling design options. Therein lies its potential in energy savings. Smart glass may be classified into three types: electrochromic, suspended particle, and polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC). Each of these types has their own mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages. Electrochromic smart glass is the most popular, currently it utilizes an electrochromic film with an ion storage layer and ion conductor placed between two transparent plates. The electrochromic film is usually made of tungsten oxide, owing to the electrochromic nature of transition metals. An electric potential initiates a redox reaction of the electrochromic film transitioning the color and the transparency of the smart glass. Suspended particle smart glass has needle shaped particles suspended within an organic gel placed between two electrodes. In its off state, the particles are randomly dispersed and have a low light transmittance. Once a voltage is applied, the needle particles will orient themselves to allow for light to pass through. PDLC smart glass works similarly to the suspended particle variety. However, in PDLC smart glass, the central layer is a liquid crystal placed within a polymer matrix between electrodes. Similar in behavior to the suspended particles, in the off position the liquid crystals are randomly dispersed and have low transmittance. With the application of a voltage, the liquid crystals orient themselves, thereby allowing for the transmittance of light. These different smart glasses have many different applications, but with one hindrance. The requirement of a voltage source is a major disadvantage which greatly complicates the overall installation and manufacturing processes. However, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) devices into smart glass technology has provided one solution. Photovoltaic films attached in the smart glass will provide the necessary voltage source. The photovoltaic film may even be designed to produce more voltage than needed. The use a photovoltaic smart glass system provides significant cost savings in regards to heating, cooling, lighting, and overall energy bills. Smart glass represents a technology with a great deal of potential to reduce energy demand. Action steps have been identified to propagate the popular use of smart glass.},

abstract = {In this pilot study, a hitherto untapped source of fuel oil delivery data is explored as representative of a potentially powerful data source for analyses of residential oil consumption. The application of PRISM to oil data is studied in two parts: a detailed examination of a small number of houses, followed by an analysis of groups of houses in disparate (urban vs. suburban) regions. Extremely good fits to the data result, with interesting differences between houses with and without oil-fueled water heaters, and with some caveats regarding the interpretability of the results. The regional comparison shows almost no dependence on type of region or subset of houses. The most important finding is that monitoring consumption in oil-heated houses is almost as straightforward as it is in gas-heated houses, provided there are sufficient oil deliveries in the time period of interest.},

The socio-economic, dwelling and electricity consumption data were collected during a large-scale, city-wide survey, carried out in Leicester, UK, in 2009–2010. Annual electrical energy demand was estimated for 315 dwellings and an odds ratio analysis used to identify the socio-economic and dwelling factors that led to high electricity consumption. The effects of a number of socio-economic and dwelling factors which have not previously been studied for the UK domestic sector are included. Thus, for the first time, presence of teenagers, having electric space heating as the primary form of heating, portable electric heating and electric water heating were identified as significant drivers of high electricity demand in UK homes. The employment status and education level of the Household Representative Person, the number of floors in a dwelling, presence of fixed electric heating, and the proportion of low-energy lighting were shown to have no effect on high electricity consumption in UK homes. Given the impetus to reduce electricity consumption and CO2 emissions from the domestic sector, these observations can help shape energy saving campaigns and future energy policy.},

Key experimental observations leading to model development are briefly reviewed. Comprehensive validation results are presented.

abstract = {Measurements of energy consumption in dwellings show that the consumption is normally distributed. The variation is wide. A statistical simulation method based on the Monte Carlo technique is used to study variation of energy consumption in dwellings. Uncertain parameters such as internal temperature and air change are assumed as distributions. Values for each parameter distribution are combined randomly. The probable energy consumption is simulated and given as a distribution instead as a single value. The method is used to study the influence of variation from climate, building and inhabitants. Variation from inhabitants is much more significant than variation from climate. It is therefore important to know the variation from inhabitants' behaviour. If the inhabitants' behaviour is unknown, it is impossible to predict the total energy consumption more accurately than ±15–20{\%} compared with the consumption found with traditional energy calculation methods. The heating and ventilation energy consumption is encumbered with an uncertainty of ±25–40{\%} if the inhabitants' behaviour is unknown. In a cold climate it is most important to study uncertainties of transmission and ventilation loss.},

A block diagram showing various factors affecting the heat balance of a building is presented in Fig. 4.3. The influence of these factors on the performance of a building can be studied using appropriate analytical tools. Several techniques are available for estimating the performance of buildings. They can be classified under Steady State methods, Dynamic methods and Correlation methods. Some of the techniques are simple and provide information on the average load or temperature, on a monthly or annual basis. Others are complex and require more detailed input information. However, the latter perform a more accurate analysis and provide results on an hourly or daily basis. In this chapter, we discuss a simple method that is easy to understand and amenable to hand calculations. Fig. 4.3 Thermal simulation flow paths of a building To understand the process of heat conduction, convection and radiation occurring in a building, consider a wall having one surface exposed to solar radiation and the other surface facing a room (Fig. 4.4). Of the total solar radiation incident on the outer surface of the wall, a part of it is reflected to the environment. The remaining part is absorbed by the wall and converted into heat energy. A part of the heat is again lost to the environment through convection and radiation from the wall's outer surface. The remaining part is conducted into the wall; where it is partly stored − thereby raising the wall temperature − while the rest reaches the room's interior surface. The inner surface transfers heat by convection and radiation to the room air, raising its temperature. Heat exchanges like these take place through opaque building elements such as walls and roofs. Additionally, mutual radiation exchanges between the inner surfaces of the building also occur (for example, between walls, or between a wall and roof). Such heat transfer processes affect the indoor temperature of a room and consequently, the thermal comfort experienced by its occupants.},

Within that context, field studies that put realizable efficiency in perspective are urgently needed. The dwelling evaluated was built in 1957. In those days energy efficiency was no concern. Houses got no insulation, ventilation was adventitious and heating systems scored badly. The retrofit started in the early eighties, stepwise as to follow the impact of separate measures on heating energy consumed. A solar boiler was installed in 2004. PV followed in 2009. The first 19 years a family of five inhabited the dwelling, then the parents only. Monitoring started in 1978. In the paper, predicted annual energy for space heating is compared with monitored result. The measured data, though showing a net decrease, consistently underscore predictions. Main reason is direct rebound. The benefits of the solar boiler and PV-panels are minimal compared to the energy avoided by better insulation, energy efficient windows, better air-tightness and upgraded ventilation and central heating. However, targeting passive house and zero energy quality is beyond optimal in terms of net present value and not doable in the dwelling.},

abstract = {The “Solar Complex of Plan-les-Ouates” is a traditional multifamily building with some commercial and administrative areas. It was designed to consume a minimum amount of thermal energy by combining several renewable energy systems (1400m2 of solar roof, buried pipe and exhausted air heat exchangers) with an optimised envelope and electrical equipment. Initially predicted to consume 160MJ/m2 per year of gas, a gas energy use index (per unit heated floor area) of 246MJ/m2 per year was measured. The energy analysis of the building, based on a 3-year period of monitoring, brought up the most relevant points that explain this difference: the real conditions of utilisation (such as the interior temperature) and the real performance of the complete technical system are not taken into account in the theoretical value. Both technical and economical aspects of the renewable energy systems were analysed in detail. An important lesson learned from this experiment is that the energy concept of buildings must be simple and consistent and the complexity of the technical installations must be carefully managed from the design-stage to the exploitation. Detailed monitoring of innovative low-energy buildings is recommended to understand the possible discrepancies between theoretical and real heat consumption and to improve the transfer of new energy technologies to large-scale real constructions.},

It's a bit like what people have done with K-means: you have an algorithm for clustering that works and is stable, so you tweak the application by swapping out distance metrics.


Using order patterns for recurrence plots is similar, you have a technique for visulizing patterns in complex time series, and you tweak it by transforming the time series from a sequence of abs values to a sequence of patterns of n sequential values, then you can do the same recurrence job.


Much like K-means though, you have the issue that it's a bit arbitrary - you don't have any reason/theory why you should do this, it just seems to give an interesting result.


Especially w.r.t Shipworth approach to research this is problematic - want to as much as possible follow the theory-experiment-result pattern.},

These measurements were repeated in 2005–2006, with the results compared with the baseline using standardised daily external conditions of 5°C. The 2005–2006 study found mean temperatures of 19.8°C (95{\%} confidence interval: 19.7–20.5) for living rooms and 19.3°C (CI: 19.6–20.1) for main bedrooms. Weak evidence was found for a 10{\%} increase in gas consumption over 15 years to 87kWh/day (95{\%}CI: 77–96) and overall electricity usage rose by 30{\%} to 15kWh/day (CI: 13.6–16.5). Dwellings were classified into three groups of low, middle, and high-energy users in 1990. In 2005–2006, this high group consumed more energy than the other two groups combined and accounted for most increases in energy use; their gas usage rose by 20{\%} to 130kWh/day (110–150), electricity by 75{\%} to 28kWh/day (CI: 25.3–31.2), and had 50{\%} higher energy intensity at 172Wh/m2 (CI: 150–195). On average the high group comprised dwellings that were larger, had been extended, and whose occupants had higher incomes than the two other groups. The results suggest that research for the development of energy policy, including building regulations, should focus both on how energy is currently used and on households where the largest future increases are likely to occur.},

abstract = {Whole building energy simulation (BES) models play a significant role in the design and optimisation of buildings. Simulation models may be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of energy-conservation measures (ECMs) in the design stage as well as assessing various performance optimisation measures during the operational stage. However, due to the complexity of the built environment and prevalence of large numbers of independent interacting variables, it is difficult to achieve an accurate representation of real-world building operation. Therefore, by reconciling model outputs with measured data, we can achieve more accurate and reliable results. This reconciliation of model outputs with measured data is known as calibration. This paper presents a detailed review of current approaches to model development and calibration, highlighting the importance of uncertainty in the calibration process. This is accompanied by a detailed assessment of the various analytical and mathematical/statistical tools employed by practitioners to date, as well as a discussion on both the problems and the merits of the presented approaches.},

abstract = {In this paper, panel methods are applied in new and innovative ways to predict daily mean internal temperature demand across a heterogeneous domestic building stock over time. This research not only exploits a rich new dataset but presents new methodological insights and offers important linkages for connecting bottom-up building stock models to human behaviour. It represents the first time a panel model has been used to estimate the dynamics of internal temperature demand from the natural daily fluctuations of external temperature combined with important behavioural, socio-demographic and building efficiency variables. The model is able to predict internal temperatures across a heterogeneous building stock to within ∼0.71°C at 95{\%} confidence and explain 45{\%} of the variance of internal temperature between dwellings. The model confirms hypothesis from sociology and psychology that habitual behaviours are important drivers of home energy consumption. In addition, the model offers the possibility to quantify take-back (direct rebound effect) owing to increased internal temperatures from the installation of energy efficiency measures. The presence of thermostats or thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) are shown to reduce average internal temperatures, however, the use of an automatic timer is shown to be statistically insignificant. The number of occupants, household income and occupant age are all important factors that explain a quantifiable increase in internal temperature demand. Households with children or retired occupants are shown to have higher average internal temperatures than households who do not. As expected, building typology, building age, roof insulation thickness, wall U-value and the proportion of double glazing all have positive and statistically significant effects on daily mean internal temperature. In summary, the model can be either used to make statistical inferences about the importance of different factors for explaining internal temperatures or as a predictive tool. However, a key contribution of this research is the possibility to use this model to calibrate existing building stock for behaviour and socio-demographic effects leading to improved estimations of domestic energy demand.},
annote = {Background
----------
Gas heating more efficienty than old, but providing instant heat means more opportunity for consumption.


Shipworth shows there's no changes in thermostat settings.


Central heating makes it possible to heat all house instead of bits of it={\textgreater} more consumption.


Ppl build increasingly sophisticated social and engineering models.


Now try to build bottom up models with proxies for human behaviour. e.g. using water consumption as proxy for occupancy.


Behaviour and social ={\textgreater} Gil et al 51{\%} variance in heat, 37{\%} elec, 11{\%} water consumption related to behaviour


Top-down models (BREDEM) assume internal temp, DON'T include estimates of temps for less than 1 month - loosing info about occupancy patterns (e.g. retired home vs active family)
={\textgreater} age/employment status may be good indicator of these


Temp is main driver of heating use - all aspects: external, demand, actual internal, rate of variation.
Short term data can trigger behaviour, e.g. early cold snap starts heating period much earlier


Contribution
-----------
Dwelling level temperature model capable of predicting internal temp from compined effects of human behaviour, env conditions, building properties


High temporal resolution


Data
----
Spot temp data collected by EHS, mostly useless.
CARB set useful


Model
-----
Panel data methods selected best for using data, widely used in quant
Cross sectional and time series data
- problem, violate OLS assumptions about error process
- time series data is self correlated
Used Random Effects model


Variables in model
- intransmultble (cannot be influences to change energy cons)
- behavioural
- physical


Model form: see eqn 1.5
Note that we're using this model to estimate internal temperature as function of inputs


Could work for mean monthly instead of mean daily by changing inputs


--lots of modelling details here. will have to read agian--


Results
------
Model good at predicting internal temp to within ±0.71°C


Explains 45{\%} of observed variance of home temps.


Find various dependancies on input vars (see highlights, transcribe later)
e.g. thermostatic controls reduce temp


See conclusion for details of each one
e.g. occupancy effects, control effects, tenure effect, impact of number of people in home


Tenure (owner-occupy vs rent) has important impact on temp


Gas Central heating DECREASES internal temp - but then 90{\%} dwellings have it, so might just be remaining 10{\%} is unusual in some way.


Relevance to rebound effect - better understand change in internal temp
={\textgreater} but not, importance of building U on temp. Since in this model variation due to occupancy and controls is already accounted for. So change with U should be the physical effect only, with other things like ppl putting higher set points already factored out. increase of 0.3°C from worst U to best U comparable to 0.5°C ish due to pure physical effects from simulation work.






Using "panel methods" to build stat model of building based on detailed data.

abstract = {The near-surface wind flow velocity and turbulence profiles in urban areas are very different to those observed in rural areas and these differences are important considerations for pollution dispersion modelling and numerical weather prediction. In urban areas, buildings increase the roughness of the surface which modifies the near-surface flow field and promotes the vertical exchange of momentum between the surface and the atmosphere. The roughness of the surface is often quantified in terms of the roughness length or the bulk drag coefficient and these values are strongly related to the size, shape and layout (morphology) of buildings in a neighbourhood. The morphology of the surface can be described quantitatively in terms of the building plan area index ($\lambda$P) and frontal area index ($\lambda$F). Existing algorithms which relate these two indices to the surface roughness often do so for idealised cube-shaped obstacles for which $\lambda$P = $\lambda$F. In the first part of this study, a GIS analysis of buildings in the Greater London area was conducted and it showed that in typical neighbourhoods, the plan and frontal area indices are not equal and therefore on average buildings are non-cubic in shape. In the second part of this study, the typical range of $\lambda$P and $\lambda$F values for London were used to design a series of non-cubic idealised obstacle arrays as part of a wind tunnel experiment. The integral momentum method was used to estimate the sensitivity of the bulk surface drag coefficient to the plan and frontal area index separately. The results prompted the modification of an existing algorithm capable of estimating the normalised roughness length for uniform height, non-cubic obstacle arrays . In the final part of the study, the variation of the roughness length due to varying wind directions was considered. Four flow processes which change with wind direction were identified, of which the surface roughness was found to be most sensitive to the frontal area index.},

abstract = {With building heating and cooling accounting for nearly 14{\%} of the national energy consumption, emerging technologies that improve building envelope performance have significant potential to reduce building energy consumption. Actual savings from these technologies will depend heavily upon their performance in diverse climate and operational conditions. In many cases, early-stage research can benefit from detailed investigation in order to develop performance thresholds and identify target markets. One example, a dynamic, highly transparent, near-infrared switching electrochromic (NEC) window glazing, is the focus of this investigation. Like conventional electrochromics, the NEC glazing can dynamically tune its optical properties with a small applied voltage. Consequently, the glazing can block or transmit solar heat to reduce cooling or heating loads, respectively. Unlike conventional electrochromics, NEC glazings remain transparent to visible light, causing no adverse effect to daylighting or building aesthetics. This study utilizes the software COMFEN to simulate a broad range of NEC performance levels, for commercial and residential buildings in 16 climate-representative reference cities. These simulations are the basis for identifying performance levels necessary to compete with existing static technologies. These results indicate that energy savings are strongly influenced by blocking-state performance. Additionally, residential applications have lower performance requirements due to their characteristic internal heat gains. Finally, the most dynamic NEC performance level is simulated in competition with high performing static alternatives. Here heating and cooling energy savings range from 5 to 11 kWh/m2 yr for commercial and 8-15 kWh/m2 yr for residential, in many regions on the order of 10{\%}. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The characteristics of a building, its design, its look and feel, and its technical standards not only influence our productivity, our well-being, our moods and our interactions with others, they also define how much energy is consumed in and by a building, and how much heating, ventilation and cooling energy is needed to create a pleasant environment. We know that buildings cause a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, mainly CO2 , altering our planet's climate. By renovating buildings to high standards of efficiency we can demonstrate that ambitious climate change mitigation actions and improvements in living quality can go hand in hand. The European building stock with its unique mix of historical and modern architecture provides both significant opportunities and challenges. Effective policies and incentive schemes to reduce the climate change footprint of buildings require a solid understanding about the current building stock.

This model is one of those used currently to estimate short time step (hourly or less) irradiance on tilted planes based on global and direct (or diffuse) irradiance. It has been shown to perform more accurately than other models for a large number of locations worldwide. The key assumptions defining the model remain basically unchanged. These include (1) a description of the sky dome featuring a circumsolar zone and horizon zone superimposed over an isotropic background, and (2) a parameterization of insolation conditions (based on available inputs to the model), determining the value of the radiant power originating from these two zones. Operational modifications performed on the model are presented in a step by step approach. Each change is justified on the basis of increased ease of use and/or overall accuracy. Two years of hourly data on tilted planes from two climatically distinct sites in France are used to verify performance accuracy. The isotropic, Hay and Klucher models are used as reference. Major changes include (1) the simplification of the governing equation by use of reduced brightness coefficients; (2) the allowance for negative coefficients; (3) reduction of the horizon band to an arc-of-great-circle; (4) optimization of the circumsolar region width; and (5) optimization of insolation conditions parameterization. ?? 1987 Pergamon Journals Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of testing BREDEM-8 and BREDEM-12 against measurements in real dwellings and against detailed simulation models. BREDEM-8 is a monthly calculation whereas BREDEM-12 works on a nominal heating season of 8 months. The BREDEM-8 results have been presented before but it is instructive to present them here again because this highlights the performance of the two versions of BREDEM relative to one another. Often all that is required of an energy calculation is a prediction of annual energy use. The results obtained indicate that in this respect the two versions of BREDEM are as good as the detailed simulation models. Both versions of BREDEM perform well in both types of test, and the predictions from the simpler seasonal calculation are as good as those from the more complex monthly calculation. This suggests that for many purposes, and in particular for those where a hand calculation option needs to be available, a seasonal calculation is quite adequate. For example, there is no point in basing an energy label such as the Standard Assessment Procedure on anything more complicated than a seasonal calculation. In situations where a computer would always be used to do the calculations, either a seasonal or a monthly calculation could be employed. The amount of data input is not significantly different in the two cases but the monthly calculation has the advantage that information on seasonal variations is available and this can be important, particularly for passive solar and low energy design purposes.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes a methodology for developing quantitative answers to the question, “How low can energy use go within the commercial buildings sector?” The basic process is to take each building in the 1999 CBECS public use data files and create a baseline building energy model for it as if it were being built new in 2005 with code-minimum energy performance. The 1999 CBECS data form a statistical model of the commercial buildings sector by using a set of 5,430 buildings with weighting factors to indicate how many more such buildings are represented by each member. For each building, we used 1999 CBECS data on floor area, number of floors, census division, basic climatic design criteria, principal building activity, and number of employees. The expanded building descriptions needed for detailed energy modeling with EnergyPlus were generated by applying ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004 and augmenting with data from Huang and Franconi (1999), probabilistic assignments, and other assumptions. The technical potential of energy design measures, for the sector as a whole, were then evaluated by altering and rerunning the energy models, comparing perturbed results to each baseline, and then aggregating performance metrics. The primary benefit of the method is that the CBECS weighting factors provide a robust way of aggregating national results from simulations of individual buildings. However, it is also challenging because it requires considerable computing resources. The methodology is recommended for future analyses when the results must properly reflect the national implications and when only a limited number of scenarios need to be investigated.},

About 2.5 years after its launch the programme was effectively terminated and is now seen as a dramatic policy failure. In this paper we analyse the reasons for the failure and the politics that led to the rise and the fall of the Green Deal. We conclude that even though the risks were understood and voiced by critics well in advance of the launch of the Green Deal, the logic of a subsidy free energy efficiency scheme became the accepted wisdom at the highest levels of Government, through a combination of ideology and failure to listen.},

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

abstract = {During the next decades the refurbishment of old buildings will be an essential way to contribute to the global improvement of buildings energy performance indicators. Within this context, the present paper is focused on the use of electrochromic (EC) windows, an emerging technology alternative to shading devices, to control solar gains in buildings located in Mediterranean climates. The optical properties adjustments of the EC glasses are discussed based on the incident solar radiation. The ESP-r building energy simulation software was used to study the energy savings resulting from the application of electrochromic windows, considering the comparison of several windows solutions (single, double-glazing and EC windows) and windows orientations (East, South and West). In addition, different transition ranges for the optical properties of the EC glasses are assessed through the analysis of the energy needs for space heating and cooling. The main conclusion is that EC technology is an effective option in cooling dominated buildings. The impact of EC windows is highly dependent on facade orientation, being a valid option particularly in the cases of the East and West facades. For these facades, the control set point found to be effective corresponds to an incident solar radiation on the glass of 150 W/m2 to impose a total coloured state. For the South facade the results show no significant advantage of using EC windows.},

Simultaneously, the Poincar{\'{e}} recurrence time has been extensively used to characterize nonlinear dynamical systems. We compare the main properties of these statistical methods pointing out their consequences for the recurrence analysis performed in time series. In particular, we analyze the dependence of the mean recurrence time and of the recurrence time statistics on the probability density function, on the interval whereto the recurrences are observed, and on the temporal correlations of time series. In the case of long-term correlations, we verify the validity of the stretched exponential distribution, which is uniquely defined by the exponent gamma, at the same time showing that it is restricted to the class of linear long-term correlated processes. Simple transformations are able to modify the correlations of time series leading to stretched exponentials recurrence time statistics with different gamma, which shows a lack of invariance under the change of observables.},

Using an ‘actor oriented approach', the paper tries to identify (a) the drivers and barriers that affect the success or failure of energy efficiency investments and (b) the institutions that are responsible for the emergence of these barriers and drivers. This taxonomy aims to synthesise ideas from three broad perspectives, viz., micro (project/end user), meso (organization), and macro (state, market, civil society). The paper develops a systematic framework by looking at the issues from the perspective of different actors. This not only aids the understanding of barriers and drivers; it also provides scope for appropriate policy interventions. This focus will help policy-makers evaluate to what extent future interventions may be warranted and how one can judge the success of particular interventions.},

This evaluation comes from an integrated approach combining the daylighting and the thermal aspects. The study presented here is based on simulation results. Several fa??ade configurations have been modeled, for the four main orientations and three combinations of internal wall reflection coefficients. These simulations were performed by coupling a daylighting simulation tool (ADELINE) and a dynamic thermal simulation software (TRNSYS). These simulations allowed us to determine the main parameters playing a rule on lighting consumption. We learned that daylighting can reduce artificial lighting consumption from 50 to 80{\%}. The global primary energy saving coming not only from the reduction of the lighting consumption but also from the reduction of lighting internal loads could then reach 40{\%}, for a type of glazing usually used in office buildings. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples, and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors. A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with mathematical theory. In the twenty years since the first edition of this book appeared, the ideas and techniques of nonlinear dynamics and chaos have found application to such exciting new fields as systems biology, evolutionary game theory, and sociophysics. This second edition includes new exercises on these cutting-edge developments, on topics as varied as the curiosities of visual perception and the tumultuous love dynamics in Gone With the Wind.},

abstract = {To properly simulate the condensation process and design a water recovery system from condensation of atmospheric water vapour on a surface maintained below the dew point by radiative heat loss from the surface to night sky, an accurate estimation of the effective sky temperature is required. To estimate the effective night sky temperature, an experimental system consisting of a series of metal plates embedded on a heat transfer panel, a weather station and a control system was used. The results obtained from theoretical analyses and preliminary experiments are presented and discussed. A special emphasis is given to a mathematical solution of the system of equations that need to be solved to obtain the effective sky temperature. It is shown that although the system of equations works well for the direct heat transfer problem, there is a serious difficulty to solve the inverse heat transfer problem to retrieve the desired parameters.},

abstract = {Residential thermostats control a substantial portion of both fuel and electrical energy—9{\%} of the total energy consumption in the U.S. Consumers install programmable thermostats to save energy, yet numerous recent studies found that homes with programmable thermostats can use more energy than those controlled manually depending on how—or if—they are used. At the same time, thermostats are undergoing a dramatic increase in capability and features, including control of ventilation, responding to electricity price signals, and interacting with a home area network. These issues warrant a review of the current state of thermostats, evaluating their effectiveness in providing thermal comfort and energy savings, and identifying areas for further improvement or research. This review covers the evolution in technologies of residential thermostats; we found few standards and many features. We discuss studies of how people currently use thermostats, finding that nearly half do not use the programming features. The review covers the complications associated with using a thermostat. Finally, we suggest research needed to design—and especially test with users—thermostats that can provide more comfortable and economical indoor environments.},

abstract = {Implementing energy conservation measures in buildings can reduce energy costs and environmental impacts, but such measures cost money to implement so intelligent investment strategies require the ability to quantify the energy savings by comparing actual energy used to how much energy would have been used in absence of the conservation measures (known as the “baseline” energy use). Methods exist for predicting baseline energy use, but a limitation of most statistical methods reported in the literature is inadequate quantification of the uncertainty in baseline energy use predictions. However, estimation of uncertainty is essential for weighing the risks of investing in retrofits. Most commercial buildings have, or soon will have, electricity meters capable of providing data at short time intervals. These data provide new opportunities to quantify uncertainty in baseline predictions, and to do so after shorter measurement durations than are traditionally used. In this paper, we show that uncertainty estimation provides greater measurement and verification (M{\&}V) information and helps to overcome some of the difficulties with deciding how much data is needed to develop baseline models and to confirm energy savings. We also show that cross-validation is an effective method for computing uncertainty. In so doing, we extend a simple regression-based method of predicting energy use using short-interval meter data. We demonstrate the methods by predicting energy use in 17 real commercial buildings. We discuss the benefits of uncertainty estimates which can provide actionable decision making information for investing in energy conservation measures.},

It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity. We close with some suggestions for future work.},

abstract = {To make robust judgments of an energy efficiency programme's economic effectiveness, we need to know how much energy and CO2 is actually being saved through the financial support it provides. But most evaluations of home retrofit energy efficiency programmes depend on calculated, rather than measured, levels of energy consumption. This fails to take into account the discrepancies that have been observed in practice, between calculated and actual energy consumption both before and after refurbishment. Evaluations of energy efficiency programmes ideally need to consider rebound effects, free rider effects, reduced savings due to insufficient technical quality, and discrepancies between actual and calculated pre-refurbishment energy consumption. This paper investigates and compares evaluations of two prominent energy efficiency programmes in the Germany and UK–the CO2-Building Rehabilitation Programme and the Supplier Obligation. We show that evaluations of the Supplier Obligation explicitly address most of the reduction effects whereas this is not the case for the CO2-Building Rehabilitation Programme.},
annote = {Problem: evaluations of savings are based on calculated rather than measured consumption values both before and after


Look at UK and Germany


Germany: Building Rehabilitation Programme
UK: Supplier Obligation




Discrepancies between calcualted and actual savings framed as "Rebound" - though also consider "prebound" (same author), on average 30{\%} LESS than expected consumption before, so overestimate size of savings


Lack of skills to do work properly


Free Rider - in terms of cost effectiveness and savings due to specific incentives, some people would have refurbished anyway without incentives.




Background
----------
UK - supplier obligation SO to promote savings
DE - CBRP Federal subsidies as reduced interest rates. Important in cost effectiveness evaluations because only federal subsidies to improvements are counted in cost but all savings are counted
={\textgreater} could be justified if what you want to know is how much savings you got out of your policy, and all you care is how much gov money you had to put in. If you stimulated private portion of spending can consider it a good thing




SO evaluations changed over times, so measurement/evaluation campagins not directly comparable




Pre/Rebound Effects
--------------


Khazzom-Brookes Postulate (never heard it called this)
Efficient use of fuel ≠ less consumption
Micro and macro level
- Only look at micro/dweling basis


Estimates around 30{\%}. Newer ones (surry paper) 15{\%}


PRebound - find that less energy efficient buildings actually consume less than calcualted
* Consumption before insulation LOWER than expected
* Contrast with higher than expected consumption afterwards
={\textgreater} user/tech interface issues, new tech designed to make it easy to use more compared to old - accessible controls, lower costs...


* switchover from prebound to rebound occurs around 100 kWh/m2
=={\textgreater} REALLY INTERESTING TO LOOK INTO THIS!




Free Rider
reduce estimated savings up to 80{\%} (Kreitler),
={\textgreater} not really interested in this aspect, is more about cost effectiveness of public policy
could be offset by free driver effect


Supplier obligation evaluation
Focus on small consumers (dwellings, small business). Use BREDEM model savings.
Evaluations EEC 1 and EEC 2.
EEC 1 used comfort factor 30{\%}
EEC 2 used 15{\%} new research (Sanders)
={\textgreater} assumed saving


CO2 building rehab eval (DE)
IKARUS space heating model

Many more evaluations of efficiency improvements from US
Evaluation techniques much more sophisticated},

Three passive design methods are described: the Solar Load Ratio (SLR) method based on correlations to simulation results; the Gordon/Zarmi closed form analytical mode;; and the ‘‘unutilizability'' model of Monsen and Klein. Model predictions are compared with measured results; agreement is good if measured building characteristics are used.

Introduction to Nonparametric Regression clearly explains the basic concepts underlying nonparametric regression and features:* Thorough explanations of various techniques, which avoid complex mathematics and excessive abstract theory to help readers intuitively grasp the value of nonparametric regression methods* Statistical techniques accompanied by clear numerical examples that further assist readers in developing and implementing their own solutions* Mathematical equations that are accompanied by a clear explanation of how the equation was derivedThe first chapter leads with a compelling argument for studying nonparametric regression and sets the stage for more advanced discussions. In addition to covering standard topics, such as kernel and spline methods, the book provides in-depth coverage of the smoothing of histograms, a topic generally not covered in comparable texts.With a learning-by-doing approach, each topical chapter includes thorough S-Plus? examples that allow readers to duplicate the same results described in the chapter. A separate appendix is devoted to the conversion of S-Plus objects to R objects. In addition, each chapter ends with a set of problems that test readers' grasp of key concepts and techniques and also prepares them for more advanced topics.This book is recommended as a textbook for undergraduate and graduate courses in nonparametric regression. Only a basic knowledge of linear algebra and statistics is required. In addition, this is an excellent resource for researchers and engineers in such fields as pattern recognition, speech understanding, and data mining. Practitioners who rely on nonparametric regression for analyzing data in the physical, biological, and social sciences, as well as in finance and economics, will find this an unparalleled resource.},

However, mod- els with more than one output quantity arise across metrology. The GUM includes examples, from electrical metrology, with three output quantities [JCGM 100:2008 H.2], and thermal metrology, with two output quan- tities [JCGM 100:2008 H.3]. This Supplement to the GUM treats multivariate measurement models, namely models with any number of output quantities. Such quantities are generally mutually correlated because they depend on common input quantities. A generalization of the GUM uncertainty framework [JCGM 100:2008 5] is used to provide estimates of the output quantities, the standard uncertainties associated with the estimates, and covariances associated with pairs of estimates. The input or output quantities in the measurement model may be real or complex. Supplement 1 to the GUM [JCGM 101:2008] is concerned with the propagation of probability distributions [JCGM 101:2008 5] through a measurement model as a basis for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty, and its implementation by a Monte Carlo method [JCGM 101:2008 7]. Like the GUM, it is only concerned with models having a single scalar output quantity [JCGM101:2008 1]. This Supplement describes a generalization of that Monte Carlo method to obtain a discrete representation of the joint probability distribution for the output quantities of a multivariate model. The discrete representation is then used to provide estimates of the output quantities, and standard uncertainties and covariances associated with those estimates. Appropriate use of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUM uncertainty framework is questionable, namely when (a) linearization of the model provides an inadequate representation, or (b) the probability distribution for the output quantity (or quantities) departs appreciably from a (multivariate) Gaussian distribution. Guidance is also given on the determination of a coverage region for the output quantities of a multivariate model, the counterpart of a coverage interval for a single scalar output quantity, corresponding to a stipulated coverage probability. The guidance includes the provision of coverage regions that take the form of hyper- ellipsoids and hyper-rectangles. A calculation procedure that uses results provided by the Monte Carlo method is also described for obtaining an approximation to the smallest coverage region. vi  JCGM 2011— All rights reserv},

abstract = {Abstract Consumer acceptance of smart meters remains crucial in achieving the potential carbon emission reductions offered by advanced metering infrastructures. Given this, the present research used deliberative focus groups to examine what is needed to secure acceptance and engagement from domestic consumers with services, products and ‘offers' in smarter power systems. Our findings suggest that consumers are able to identify not just threats relating to smart metering initiatives but opportunities as well. In particular, our focus group participants responded positively to the idea of an automated system that could be used to achieve energy savings in combination with time-of-use tariffs. We conclude by outlining suggestions for policy recommendations that may help consumer acceptance of smart meter enabled services be more readily achieved.},

abstract = {Recital 16 of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) requires the energy certificate to describe a building's actual energy-performance situation to the extent possible. If we wish to achieve the rapid reductions in energy use and CO2 emissions that the EPBD anticipates, it is vital that this clause is taken seriously. It provides a fantastic opportunity to report actual energy use clearly, to grade it against a clear description of the building in use, and to relate it transparently to expectations at the design stage. This will at last begin to close the feedback loop, reduce the credibility gaps that so often occur between design expectations of energy efficiency and actual fuel consumption outcomes, and consequently lead to more rapid improvements in building energy performance. Credibility gaps arise not so much because predictive techniques are “wrong”, but because the assumptions often used are not well enough informed by what really happens in practice, because few people who design buildings go on to monitor their performance. While some differences are legitimate (e.g. the building is used more, or has more things in it), surveys nearly always reveal avoidable waste - which can arise from poor briefing, design, construction and commissioning, and not just bad training, bad maintenance and bad management. A widespread problem is control systems which just do not work, or have poor management and user interfaces, resulting in equipment defaulting to ON unnecessarily. To achieve genuine step-change improvements, procuring clients, design and building teams, users and managers will all need to engage much more closely with achieved performance. Better transparency between intentions and outcomes will release drivers towards better assumptions, better predictions, better design, better implementation, and better management of both the procurement and the product. We discuss how certification might be developed to help identify and close the credibility gaps, and present an idea for an energy certificate which takes these issues into account. Introduction},

Applicability of the clearness-index (K) and sunshine fraction (SSO) models for diffuse estimation and the effect of combining several variables into a single multilinear equation are tested. Correlations connecting the diffuse to global fraction (HdH) with K and SSO predict Hd values more accurately than their separate use. Among clearness-index and sunshine-fraction models, SSO models are found to have better accuracy if correlations are developed for wide latitude ranges. By including a term for declinations in the correlation, the accuracy of the estimated data can be marginally improved. The addition of latitude to the equation does not help to improve the accuracy further.},

The UK housing stock is replaced at a low rate of about 1{\%} a year, so to cut energy use it is essential to address the challenges of existing buildings. This will involve reducing energy demand through passive measures such as retrofitted insulation, replacement of windows and proper airtightness, while ensuring adequate ventilation. Active measures include upgrading improved boilers and adding locally produced energy from wind, biomass, solar power and other sources. The introduction of Display Energy Certificates will increase energy awareness but there will also need to be a programme of increased demolition for the worst-performing homes. In addition, buildings will need to be adapted to cope with worse weather, higher temperatures and increased flood risk as climate change takes effect. Overheating, rather than excessive cold, is set to become a growing problem for householders and employees in existing UK buildings.},

The prevalent use of short payback "rule-of-thumb" requirements to screen efficiency projects for risk is shown to bias investment choices towards "sure bet" investments bypassing many profitable efficiency investment options. A risk management investment strategy is presented as an alternative to risk avoidance practices applied with payback thresholds. The financial industry risk management tool Value-at-Risk is described and extended to provide an Energy-Budgets-at-Risk or EBaR risk management analysis to convey more accurate energy efficiency investment risk information. The paper concludes with recommendations to expand the use of Value-at-Risk-type energy efficiency analysis.},

abstract = {In Europe, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) provides for compulsory energy performance certification (labelling) for all existing dwellings. In the Netherlands, a labelling scheme was introduced in 2008. Certificates contain the energy label of the dwelling and corresponding theoretical gas and electricity consumption, calculated based on the dwellings physical characteristics, its heating, ventilation and cooling systems and standard use characteristics. This paper reports on a large-scale study of around 200,000 dwellings comparing labels and theoretical energy use with data on actual energy use. The study shows that dwellings with a low energy label actually consume much less energy than predicted by the label, but on the other hand, energy-efficient dwellings consume more than predicted. In practice, policy targets are set according to the theoretical rather than the actual consumptions of the building stock. In line with identified discrepancies, the study shows that whereas most energy reduction targets can be met according to the theoretical energy consumption of the dwelling stock, the future actual energy reduction potential is much lower and fails to meet most of the current energy reduction targets. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Solar energy use in the UK is increasing dramatically, providing both heat energy and generation of electricity. This trend is expected to continue due to solar technologies becoming cheaper and more readily available along with low carbon government legislation such as the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and Feed in Tariffs (FiTs) supporting solar energy deployment. However, the effects of climate change on the solar resource remain largely unstudied. Climate change affects cloud cover characteristics and consequently directly affects the performance of solar energy technologies. This paper investigates the UK solar irradiation resource for both the present and future climates. The present solar irradiation level was assessed through the conversion of 30 years of observed historical monthly average sunshine duration data. The method and results are validated by comparing the converted solar irradiation levels to actual solar irradiance measurements at weather stations with significant historical records of solar irradiance data. The impact of climate change is investigated across different regions of the UK by using the UKCP09 probabilistic climate change projections. We find that the current average UK annual solar resource is 101.2 Wm−2, ranging from 128.4 Wm−2 in the south of England to 71.8 Wm−2 in the northwest of Scotland. It seems likely that climate change will increase the average resource in the south of the UK, while marginally decreasing it in the Northwest. The overall effect is a mean increase of the UK solar resource, however it will have greater seasonal variability and discrepancies between geographical regions will be reinforced.},

abstract = {About HyperPhysics Rationale for Development HyperPhysics is an exploration environment for concepts in physics which employs concept maps and other linking strategies to facilitate smooth navigation. For the most part, it is laid out in small segments or "cards", true to its original development in HyperCard. The entire environment is interconnected with thousands of links, reminiscent of a neural network. The bottom bar of each card contains links to major concept maps for divisions of physics, plus a "go back" feature to allow you to retrace the path of an exploration. The side bar contains a link to the extensive Index, which itself is composed of active links. That sidebar also contains links to relevant concept maps. The rationale for such concept maps is to provide a visual survey of conceptually connected material, and it is hoped that they will provide some answers to the question "where do I go from here?". Whether you need further explanation of concepts which underly the current card content, or are seeking applications which go beyond it, the concept map may help you find the desired information. Part of the intent for this exploration environment is to provide many opportunities for numerical exploration in the form of active formuli and standard problems implemented in Javascript. An active exploration in physics will typically lead you to something which needs to be quantified, and it is hoped that the many Javascript-enabled calculations will provide many opportunities to answer "What if .." type questions. New content for HyperPhysics will be posted as it is developed. The intent is to maintain the entire HyperPhysics project on the Web with stable locations so that links to it may be established with confidence that they will be there for an extended period of time. As the basic phase nears completion, the author is interested in extensions to specific applied areas. If you are interested in developing specific material for a specialized course, you might consider building it upon this framework with links to HyperPhysics to provide the basic conceptual background. The entire HyperPhysics project can be made available on a cross-platform CD ROM since it will remain compatible with the standard web browsers.},

abstract = {The work of this thesis was undertake to address an urgent need to describe the European building stock, so as to allow future assessments of the effects of different energy-saving measures. The available information on building stocks in Europe is very limited. In this respect, this work contributes to the compilation of a European building stock database. The French building stock is described in this thesis by means of archetype buildings, following a methodology that was developed earlier within the Pathways Project . A bottom-up approach is used for this description, starting with segmentation of the building stock into archetype buildings, followed by characterization of these buildings and quantification of all the buildings represented by the archetype buildings. These archetype buildings are used as inputs for the Energy, Carbon and Cost Assessment for Building Stocks (ECCABS) simulation tool, to calculate the energy demand (for heating, hot water, and electricity) of the stock. The resulting energy demand is thereafter compared to the values for energy consumption in France, obtained from statistical databases, to validate the method. In this thesis, we estimate that 54 residential buildings and 45 non-residential archetype buildings would be needed to describe the entire French building stock. The calculated final energy demand (disregarding the energy used for cooking) is 435.7 TWh/year for the residential sector and non-residential 179.4 TWh/year for the nonresidential sector. These values are slightly lower (between 1.1{\%} and 7.4{\%} lower) than those in the official statistics. It is concluded that the French building stock can be described using the data available in the literature and the applied methodology. In addition, it is demonstrated that the vi ECCABS model is suitable for application to a temperate climate country, such as France.},

abstract = {Energy consumption from the residential sector is a complex socio-technical problem that can be explained using a combination of physical, demographic and behavioural characteristics of a dwelling and its occupants. A structural equation model (SEM) is introduced to calculate the magnitude and significance of explanatory variables on residential energy consumption. The benefit of this approach is that it explains the complex relationships that exist between manifest variables and their overall effect though direct, indirect and total effects. Using the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) consisting of 2531 unique cases, the main drivers behind residential energy consumption are found to be the number of household occupants, floor area, household income, dwelling efficiency (SAP), household heating patterns and living room temperature. In the multivariate case, SAP explains very little of the variance of residential energy consumption. However, this procedure fails to account for simultaneity bias between energy consumption and SAP. Using SEM its shown that dwelling energy efficiency (SAP), has reciprocal causality with dwelling energy consumption and the magnitude of these two effects are calculable. When non-recursivity between SAP and energy consumption is allowed for, SAP is shown to have a negative effect on energy consumption but conversely, homes with a propensity to consume more energy also have higher SAP rates.},
annote = {Premise
-------
Structural equation model SEM
- first known application to residential energy consumption
- Do sensitivity analysis


Direct and indirect effects that can be correlated/act as proxies, e.g. houshold income and floor area (rich ppl have large houses, use more energy, but might be more efficient per unit area)


Link SAP rating and actual consumption ={\textgreater} do find relationship.


Background
----------
Two general approaches to modelling: Top down econometric, multiple linear regression. Bottom up - from building physics and experimental data
Also hybrids with Econ, physics, GIS...
Bottom up needs a lot of detailed data


Method
------
Use publically available data from 1996 EHCS data (new 2011 data available soon)
SEM prefers parsimony of variables
Choose ones which seem will best explain variation
- num occupants
- household income
- floor area
- SAP rating
- deltaT intern extern
- energy pattern (0-5 describing frequency) based on survey
- energy consumption from supplier
- age of head of household
- degree days
- urban dummy 0/1
- owner dummy 0/1 (owner-occupier)
- economic status 0/1 (un)employment
- energy prices ={\textgreater} important but can't really study in cross sectional view (vs over time). Summerfield indicates inelastic, small impact of price on consumption



OUTLIERS

Truncated to five standard deviations from mean (no specific justification given, tho 5sigma used in particle physics, anything outside should be really rare 1in2million change).


Missing data - 5{\%} missing is ok.


Weighting - not much info. Important for EHS studies since explicit wieghting calced to allow sample cohort to represent whole population.
= increase accuracy, reduced precision
Calc "effective sample size"


Model
-----
Represent causal relationships as Path Diagram
Correlation Matrix in AMOS 18.0
Assume stationary + equilibrium


WRSWR, bootstrapping ={\textgreater} other methods to explore weighted inputs


Bootstrapping with replacement to estimate errors/variances


Results
------
Start with MLR model to test predictive power of SAP (note this is not w.r.t rebound but to straight rating of housing from inputs)
={\textgreater}Although SAP is statistically significant is is covariant with consumption in the right direction, only small portion of energy consumption variance can be ascribed to SAP when controlling for other factors!
={\textgreater} This undermines the premise of energy saving predictions.
={\textgreater} But simple MLR assumes independant variables, so doesn't allow for covariance/co-causailty of variables (variables affect each other recursively)





Test causal paths. Find that SAP and Energy Expenditure are non-recursive
={\textgreater} i.e. you can't just substitute one for the other. Important since SAP should predict an energy expenditure, but doesn't apparently do so well enough that you can just use one varialbe
={\textgreater} don't like using SAP as an input. it already wraps up a lot of stuff and muddies the water. several independant variables tested are also inputs to SAP!



Found that Urban/rural var stat significant, but damaged model fit- excluded


Validation
---------
Bunch of goodness-of-fit indexes for modelling method
Standardized root mean square residual is among best - can be cross compared with different modeling methods.


Lack of statistical building stock models makes validation harder


US studies found similar results


Discussion
---------


Occupancy has a direct +ive effect on floor area and HHLD income. Is also strongly "mediated" by HHLD income and floor area.


Need to calculate total effects of HHLD from both direct effect and effect via floor area and temp difference


No longitudinal data (time interval data) ={\textgreater} problematic for measuring temp impact, only 1 day recorded ={\textgreater} weak stat significance of var.


Relation between SAP and Energy Expenditure
(still don't really get this part)
- anyway, find that larger, more energy consuming buildings (warmed, more occupied, etc) also have better SAP ratings - wealthier people live in better houses but bigger and warmer, would consume even more if they weren't also somewhat insulated


Rebound
--------
Definitely find that better SAP gives lower demand, so idea that all gains are lost thru rebound is wrong.},

Energy consumption and CO2emissions of urban dwellings can be predicted quickly and robustly without costly on-site measurements or statistically derived geometrical models. Urban areas of almost arbitrary size can be modelled and accuracy can be incrementally improved with additional data. The model is validated by comparison with results produced by the UK's National Home Energy Rating scheme software using complete site-surveyed datasets. Its ability to rapidly estimate energy demand is demonstrated for around 400 dwellings in Leicester, UK using only the dwelling age, the default data system and the GIS tools.},

A better understanding of the adoption and diffusion of energy-efficient and renewables-based residential heating systems (RHS) is of high policy relevance, particularly against the background of climate change, security of energy supply and increasing energy prices. In this paper, we explore the multi-dimensionality of the homeowners' motivation to decide between competing RHS. A questionnaire survey (N=2440) conducted in 2010 among homeowners who had recently installed a RHS provides the empirical foundation. Principal component analysis shows that 25 items capturing different adoption motivations can be grouped around six dimensions: (1) cost aspects, (2) general attitude towards the RHS, (3) government grant, (4) reactions to external threats (i.e., environmental or energy supply security considerations), (5) comfort considerations, and (6) influence of peers. Moreover, a cluster analysis with the identified motivational factors as segmentation variables reveals three adopter types: (1) the convenience-oriented, (2) the consequences-aware, and (3) the multilaterally-motivated RHS adopter. Finally, we show that the influence of the motivational factors on the adoption decision also differs by certain characteristics of the homeowner and features of the home.},

abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

abstract = {Guideline 14 was developed by ASHRAE to fill a need for a standardized set of energy (and demand) savings calculation procedures. The intent is to provide guidance on minimum acceptable levels of performance for determining energy and demand savings, using measurements, in commercial transactions. Note that it is entirely possible to have a sale/ purchase, lease, or other arrangement for energy-efficient equipment that does not involve measurements. Indeed, the vast majority of transactions are of this type. However, if the savings determination is to be based on measurements, certain minimum requirements are necessary in order to avoid a process that appears to be based on actual savings but might be highly inaccurate, biased, or random. It is expected that ASHRAE Guideline 14 will be used for transactions between energy service companies (ESCOs) and their customers and between ESCOs and utilities, where the utilities have elected to purchase energy savings. Use of ASHRAE Guideline 14 is expected to provide savings results sufficiently well specified and reasonably accurate so that the parties to the transaction can have adequate assurance for the payment basis. Other applications of ASHRAE Guideline 14 may include documenting energy savings for various credit programs, e.g., emission reduction credits associated with energy efficiency activities. Determining savings with measurements in accordance with this guideline involves measuring post-retrofit energy use and comparing that to the measured pre-retrofit use, adjusted or normalized, to act as a proxy for the conditions that would have prevailed had the retrofit not been performed. Therefore, determining energy savings through the use of measurements involves more than just verifying that new equipment has been installed and can function as expected, although those tasks are usually a necessary part of determining savings. In addition, energy savings cannot be claimed to be “measured” if no pre-retrofit data are available. Sampling is often used in projects involving end-use monitoring or what we call the “retrofit isolation approach.” Annex B gives procedures to calculate the added uncertainty due to sampling. ASHRAE Guideline 14 may be used to measure the energy savings from a utility sponsored or contracted multiple-building energy conservation project. Applying ASHRAE Guideline 14 to such a project would allow the use of Annex B to calculate the measurement uncertainty directly. The net impacts of large-scale utility energy conservation programs, such as those that may involve market transformation or standard offers for purchase of conservation energy, are specifically excluded from the scope of ASHRAE Guideline 14, although individual and multiple-building projects within such programs are covered. ASHRAE Guideline 14 primarily addresses measurements of energy and demand for determining savings. Other tasks are needed in any energy performance contract. These can include determining appropriate utility rates, inspecting and commissioning equipment, etc. Users of ASHRAE Guideline 14 who are interested in learning more about some of thecontractual issues and types of performance contracts will find relevant discussion in the DOE publication “International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol” (IPMVP 2000) available at {\textless}www.ipmvp.org{\textgreater}.},

abstract = {The building stock is one of the most important energy consumers worldwide. Therefore, a number of energy reduction targets and regulations exist for the construction sector. Different building stock models have been developed in order to investigate the potentials of energy-efficiency and changes in energy source in the building stock. However, these models often have important shortcomings, since they are single-issued and do not include the life cycle of buildings. Thus, we propose an innovative assessment methodology in the form of a life cycle-based building stock model (LC-Build). The building stock is clustered in building cohorts of similar construction and equipment characteristics in terms of type, construction period and building technology systems. The most important building components are assigned specific thermal transmittance values. Figures for diffusion and retrofit rate describe the development of the building stock fabric. Additionally, environmental impact from the energy supply side is taken into account. This approach facilitates the evaluation of the effectiveness of measures and their dynamics on the building stock, such as newer and more efficient technologies and practices related to energy policies and prices. Furthermore, the model has a direct relationship to the construction activity (energy-efficiency measures, substitution of fossil energy based heating systems) and fosters the comprehension of material flows, related environmental impact, and costs. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated by means of a case study in the city of Zurich in Switzerland. The results suggest that Zurich has a remarkable potential to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector: 85{\%} by 2050. The case study highlights the advantages of the proposed modeling approach. The LC-Build is a valuable tool to identify and test sustainable energy targets for building stocks, such as the European 20-20-20 target. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In subtropical Hong Kong, solar heat through fenestration, particularly on vertical surfaces, plays a major role in determining the thermal performance of a building. For sizing air-conditioning equipment, maximum solar heat gain factors (SHGFs) are used for estimating the design peak load. Recently, the SHGF data representing the prevailing weather conditions have become important and more practical for evaluating daylighting designs and the determination overall thermal transfer value (OTTV). This paper describes a procedure for calculating hourly SHGFs for horizontal and vertical surfaces based on the 8-year (1991 to 1998) horizontal global and diffuse radiation and the 3-year (1996 to 1998) vertical global solar radiation data measured at the City University of Hong Kong. A simple approach for estimation of solar heat gain is developed. Average and peak SHGFs and sky factors for OTTV are computed and compared. An analysis of the SHGF data has shown that except for the north-facing surface, the ASHRAE clear sky approach tends to overestimate the solar heat gains, particularly at large significant levels. The findings provide information for the determination of the total air-conditioning plant capacity at peak load operation and multiple equipment sizing under part load condition.},

abstract = {A simulation of the earth's clear-sky long-wave radiation budget is used to examine the dependence of clear-sky outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) on surface temperature and relative humidity. the simulation uses the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global reanalysed fields to calculate clear-sky OLR over the period from January 1979 to December 1993, thus allowing the seasonal and interannual time-scales to be resolved. the clear-sky OLR is shown to be primarily dependent on temperature changes at high latitudes and on changes in relative humidity at lower latitudes. Regions exhibiting a ‘super-greenhouse' effect are identified and are explained by considering the changes in the convective regime associated with the Hadley circulation over the seasonal cycle, and with the Walker circulation over the interannual time-scale. the sensitivity of clear-sky OLR to changes in relative humidity diminishes with increasing relative humidity. This is explained by the increasing saturation of the water-vapour absorption bands with increased moisture. By allowing the relative humidity to vary in specified vertical slabs of the troposphere over an interannual time-scale it is shown that changes in humidity in the mid troposphere (400 to 700 hPa) are of most importance in explaining clear-sky OLR variations. Relative humidity variations do not appear to affect the positive thermodynamic water-vapour feedback significantly in response to surface temperature changes.},

abstract = {Switchable electrochromic (EC) windows have been projected to significantly reduce the energy use of buildings nationwide. This study quantifies the potential impact of electrochromic windows on US primary energy use in the commercial building sector and also provides a broader database of energy use and peak demand savings for perimeter zones than that given in previous LBNL simulation studies. The DOE-2.1E building simulation program was used to predict the annual energy use of a three-storey prototypical commercial office building located in five US climates and 16 California climate zones. The energy performance of an electrochromic window controlled to maintain daylight illuminance at a prescribed setpoint level is compared to conventional and the best available commercial windows as well as windows defined by the ASHRAE 90.1-1999 and California Title 24-2005 Prescriptive Standards. Perimeter zone energy use and peak demand savings data by orientation, window size, and climate are given for windows with interior shading, attached shading, and horizon obstructions (to simulate an urban environment). Perimeter zone primary energy use is reduced by 10-20{\%} in east, south, and west zones in most climates if the commercial building has a large window-to-wall area ratio of 0.60 compared to a spectrally selective low-e window with daylighting controls and no interior or exterior shading. Peak demand for the same condition is reduced by 20-30{\%}. The emerging electrochromic window with daylighting controls is projected to save approximately 91.5-97.3 1012 Btu in the year 2030 compared to a spectrally selective low- E window with manually-controlled interior shades and no daylighting controls if it reaches a 40{\%} market penetration level in that year.},

abstract = {This paper examines residential energy use in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Norway and Sweden, over the period 1973–1999. The paper uses a decomposition approach to investigate differences in residential energy demand structure and end-use intensities and discusses both differences in absolute levels of energy use and differences over time. Comparisons are also made to other countries that have been analysed in the IEA energy efficiency indicator project. The analysis shows that, in contrast to Denmark and Sweden, Norway saw a growth in total residential energy use between 1973 and 1999. This can be partially explained by the fact that Norway started from a lower per capita income level in the early 1970s but has since then enjoyed a rapid income growth that drove up house area and consequently put a pressure on energy use. But the analysis also shows that Denmark and Sweden achieved significant reductions of residential energy intensities between 1973 and 1990, while the reductions in Norway were negligible. After 1990, the picture changed; there was a strong decline in residential energy intensities in Norway and a high rate of energy savings compared to most other countries analysed by the IEA, while energy savings in Denmark and Sweden more or less came to a halt.},

We apply our method on a data set of 1628 households' electricity consumption. The results show that weather, location and floor area are among the most important determinants of residential electricity consumption. In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption.},

The review reveals that theoretical calculations, measurements in full-scale rooms and simulations with validated lighting programs indicate that an energy intensity of around 10kWh/m2yr is a realistic target for office electric lighting in future low energy office buildings. This target would yield a significant reduction in energy intensity of at least 50{\%} compared to the actual average electricity use for lighting (21kWh/m2yr in Sweden). Strategies for reducing energy use for electric lighting are presented and discussed, which include: improvements in lamp, ballast and luminaire technology, use of task/ambient lighting, improvement in maintenance and utilization factor, reduction of maintained illuminance levels and total switch-on time, use of manual dimming and switch-off occupancy sensors. Strategies based on daylight harvesting are also presented and the relevant design aspects such as effects of window characteristics, properties of shading devices, reflectance of inner surfaces, ceiling and partition height are discussed.},

abstract = {As output from photovoltaic (PV) panels is closely related to sunlight levels, monitoring solar irradiance levels is crucial for system design and predictive purposes. With advances in PV technology, urban sites at northerly locations, where both horizontal and vertical solar irradiance make significant contributions, are becoming increasingly important. The aim of this paper is to compare solar irradiance for horizontal and vertical orientations and to assess the relative effectiveness of differing averages, from 10 min to 1 h, for use in short-term prediction of solar irradiance levels for a UK site. Vertical and horizontal solar irradiance observations were collected from a monitoring station on the roof of a five-storey building at an urban site in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK (latitude 55°N). 10-min data was collected for 13- or 15-day periods in two summers (1994, 1995) and two winters (1993, 1994). Although mean levels for horizontal and vertical irradiance were different, as expected, general patterns were very similar indicating the possibility of predicting vertical irradiance from horizontal at the same location. 10-min, 20-min, 30-min and 1-h averaging times were compared utilising autocorrelation coefficients and ARIMA models to assess the information lost when using longer averaging intervals. For consideration of short-term changes, 10-min averages were most informative whilst hourly averages were substantially poorer.},

@article{OECD/IEA2016,
abstract = {The International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous agency, was established in November 1974. Its primary mandate was – and is – two-fold: to promote energy security amongst its member countries through collective response to physical disruptions in oil supply, and provide authoritative research and analysis on ways to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 member countries and beyond. The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy co-operation among its member countries, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports. The Agency's aims include the following objectives: n Secure member countries' access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular, through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions. n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute to climate change. n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of energy data. n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement and dialogue with non-member countries, industry, international organisations and other stakeholders. The Paris Agreement on climate change, which entered into force in November 2016, is at its heart an agreement about energy. Transformative change in the energy sector, the source of at least two-thirds of greenhouse-gas emissions, is essential to reach the objectives of the Agreement. The changes already underway in the energy sector, demonstrating the promise and potential of low-carbon energy, in turn lend credibility to meaningful action on climate change. Growth in energy-related CO 2 emissions stalled completely in 2015. This was mainly due to a 1.8{\%} improvement in the energy intensity of the global economy, a trend bolstered by gains in energy efficiency, as well as the expanded use of cleaner energy sources worldwide, mostly renewables. An increasing slice of the roughly {\$}1.8 trillion of investment each year in the energy sector has been attracted to clean energy, at a time when investment in upstream oil and gas has fallen sharply. The value of fossil-fuel consumption subsidies dropped in 2015 to {\$}325 billion, from almost {\$}500 billion the previous year, reflecting lower fossil-fuel prices but also a subsidy reform process that has gathered momentum in several countries. The renewables-led transformation of the power sector has given focus to a new debate over power market design and electricity security, while traditional energy security concerns have not gone away. Adding in issues of energy access, affordability, climate change and energy-related air pollution, as well as problems with public acceptance for different types of energy projects, there are many trade-offs, co-benefits and competing priorities that need to be untangled across the energy sector. This is the task that the World Energy Outlook (WEO) takes up in different scenarios and case studies, with the additional opportunity in 2016 to provide the first comprehensive examination of the new era opened up by the Paris Agreement. All the Paris climate pledges, covering some 190 countries, have been examined in detail and incorporated into our main scenario. More stringent decarbonisation options examined in WEO-2016 include not only the 450 Scenario (consistent with a 50{\%} chance of limiting global warming to 2 °C) but also a first examination of pathways that could limit warming further.},

abstract = {Retrofitting existing buildings is urgent given the increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of the existing building stock. This paper presents a scalable, probabilistic methodology that can support large scale investments in energy retrofit of buildings while accounting for uncertainty. The methodology is based on Bayesian calibration of normative energy models. Based on CEN-ISO standards, normative energy models are light-weight, quasi-steady state formulations of heat balance equations, which makes them appropriate for modeling large sets of buildings efficiently. Calibration of these models enables improved representation of the actual buildings and quantification of uncertainties associated with model parameters. In addition, the calibrated models can incorporate additional uncertainties coming from retrofit interventions to generate probabilistic predictions of retrofit performance. Probabilistic outputs can be straightforwardly translated to quantify risks of under-performance associated with retrofit interventions. A case study demonstrates that the proposed methodology with the use of normative models can correctly evaluate energy retrofit options and support risk conscious decision-making by explicitly inspecting risks associated with each retrofit option.},

@article{Hastie2009,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {There have been many published articles describing solar position algorithms for solar radiation applications. The best uncertainty achieved in most of these articles is greater than ±0.01° in calculating the solar zenith and azimuth angles. For some, the algorithm is valid for a limited number of years varying from 15 years to a hundred years. This report is a step by step procedure for implementing an algorithm to calculate the solar zenith and azimuth angles in the period from the year −2000 to 6000, with uncertainties of ±0.0003°. The algorithm is described in a book written by Jean Meeus in 1998. This report is written in a step by step format to simplify the complicated steps described in the book, with a focus on the sun instead of the planets and stars in general. It also introduces some changes to accommodate for solar radiation applications. The changes include changing the direction of measuring azimuth angles to be measured from north and eastward instead of being measured from south and eastward, and the direction of measuring the observer's geographical longitude to be measured as positive eastward from Greenwich meridian instead of negative. This report also includes the calculation of incidence angle for a surface that is tilted to any horizontal and vertical angle, as described by Iqbals in 1983.},

abstract = {Material usage and the related embodied environmental impact have grown in significance in the built environment. Therefore, cities and governments need to develop strategies to reduce both the consumption of resources during usage phase as well as the embodied impact of the current building stock. This article proposes a new component-based building inventory database as a basis to develop such strategies using building stock modeling. The developed database clusters the building stock according to building typology (single- family houses, multifamily houses, and office buildings), age, and the main construction systems of the different building components. Based on the component makeup, it lists the necessary material input and waste output for different refurbishment options for each building component. The advantages of the proposed database structure are shown based on two applications for the developed database for Switzerland. The component- based database allows optimization of refurbishment strategies not only from an energetic perspective, but also with respect to materials, both on the input (sourcing of materials) and the output (waste streams) level. The database structure makes it possible to continuously extend the data set by adding new refurbishment options or add data such as component- specific lifetimes, costs, or labor intensities of the refurbishment options. In combination with an aligned economic model, this would give an even more holistic view, impact, and feasibility of different refurbishment scenarios both in environmental and economic terms.},

abstract = {Energy used in dwellings is an important target for actions aimed at averting climate change. It is increasingly recognized that these actions may also have near-term effects on health arising from changes to the indoor environment. As part of a major study of such health effects, we modelled hypothetical household energy interventions for the UK of the type and scale needed to meet near-term (nominally 2030) abatement targets. Here we provide details of the elements of our model that address the relationships between the fabric and ventilation improvements and changes in indoor temperature during the heating season – the ‘temperature take back factor'. We demonstrate that the scale of these interventions is consistent with the emission reductions proposed by the UK Climate Change Committee, and estimate that, in the UK the consequent reduction in exposure to indoor cold may result in around 4400 fewer disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) each year. The inclusion of the temperature take back factor for the fabric and ventilation interventions reduces the relevant expected CO2 reductions by {\~{}} 6{\%}. Practical},

abstract = {Bootstrap methods are computer-intensive methods of statistical analysis that use simulation to calculate standard errors, confidence intervals and significance tests. The methods are not only in general use by statisticians, but also are applied by quantitative researchers in the life sciences, medical sciences, social sciences, business, econometrics, and other areas where statistics is used. The methods apply for any level of modelling, and so can be used for fully parametric, semiparametric, and completely nonparametric analysis. This book gives a broad and up-to-date coverage of bootstrap methods with numerous applied examples, together with the underlying general concepts and basic theory without emphasis on mathematical rigour. Applications include stratified data; finite populations; censored and missing data; linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models; time series and spatial problems. Special features of the book include: extensive discussion of significance tests and confidence intervals; material on various diagnostic methods; and methods for efficient computation, including improved Monte Carlo simulation. Each chapter includes both practical and theoretical exercises. A valuable supplement is a disk of purpose-written S-Plus programs for implementing the methods described in the text. The emphasis is on practicalities, with detailed examples of how to apply the methods, will make the book indispensable to users, teachers and students of statistical methods.},

abstract = {The success of current attempts to distinguish between low-dimensional chaos and random behavior in a time series of observations is considered. First we discuss stationary stochastic processes which produce finite numerical estimates of the correlation dimension and K2 entropy under naive application of correlation integral methods. We then consider several straightforward tests to evaluate whether correlation integral methods reflect the global geometry or the local fractal structure of the trajectory. This determines whether the methods are applicable to a given series; if they are we evaluate the significance of a particular result, for example, by considering the results of the analysis of stochastic signals with statistical properties similar to those of observed series. From the examples considered, it is clear that the correlation integral should not be used in isolation, but as one of a collection of tools to distinguish chaos from stochasticity.},

abstract = {The national roll-out of smart meters is an opportunity to improve consumer information on energy use through the integration of home energy displays with the smart meter technology. This study sought to define a core specification for these real-time energy displays, derived from a qualitative investigation of consumer experience of the electricity displays currently available on the market. The study recruited a total of 38 participants to five demographically differentiated focus groups, each of which met twice. At the first meeting, each group designed an ideal home energy display based on participants' ideas of what they thought such a display ought to include. Participants then spent a week using existing models at home. At the second meeting, the groups reviewed their experience and revised their designs accordingly. The study found remarkable convergence in the groups' final designs, enabling the clear specification of a core set of features and functionality for home energy displays. Only one of the displays used in the study, the GEO minim, comes close to meeting this specification. Despite a relatively well developed display industry in the UK, the majority of the home energy displays currently on the market do not have the functionality that consumers identify, in practice, as being critical to display design. Hence `the market' cannot be relied on to deliver an outcome that is optimal for consumers.},

In this work, we investigate the delivery of heated thermal comfort with a lower energy demand through four types of energy efficiency interventions: passive system, conversion device, method of service control, and level of service demanded. These are compared for three distinct household occupancy patterns, corresponding to a working family, a working couple and a daytime-dwelling couple. Energy efficiency measures are considered singly and in combination, to study whether multiple lower cost measures can achieve comparable savings to higher cost individual measures. Scenarios are simulated using engineering building modelling software TRNSYS with data taken from literature. Upgraded insulation of wall and roof resulted in highest savings in all occupancy scenarios, but comparable savings were calculated for reduced internal temperature and partial spatial heating in scenarios in which the house is not at maximum capacity. Zonal heating control is expected to achieve greatest savings for the working couple who had a flexible occupancy pattern. The results from this modelling work show the extent to which energy consumption depends on the appropriate matching between energy efficiency measures and occupant type.},

abstract = {EN ISO 13790 is the international standard used for the calculation of the thermal energy requirement of buildings. The evaluation of solar gains through the glazed surfaces is done with a simplified procedure that determines the transmitted solar energy through the transparent surfaces as the product of the normal incidence solar gain coefficient ggl,n and a correction factor FW, that considers the directional aspects of the beam solar radiation. In the absence of adequate national guidelines, the correction coefficient FW in EN ISO 13790 for non-scattering glazing is set constant and equal to 0.90. In this paper, the results obtained by the TRNSYS computer code demonstrate that a generalized use of a constant value of FW=0.90 provides significant deviations. Therefore, a correlation to evaluate a variable FW coefficient, in function of the incidence angle of solar radiation and of the number of glass panes, is reported. The accuracy of the obtained results was verified comparing the calculated values with those provided by the TRNSYS software. Finally, with reference to two buildings located in two localities with different weather data, the thermal energy needs by applying the EN ISO 13790 procedure with FW=0.90 and with variable FW have been compared.},

Review of studies comparing expected and actual energy savings.
Defines
* Reduction Factor = total difference between expected and actual savings
* Comfort Factor = part of total reduction factor due to increased internal building temperature.


Notes great diversity in methodology, making it comparisons more difficult. Also found discrepancies within studies themselves.


All used BREDEM(-8) building models in some way to get expected savings. Not all used it appropriately [need to figure out what is appropriate]


* Reduciton factor increases with passage of time
* Reduction factor correlated to level of fuel use before refurbishment, lower pre- users used more post- (could be that pre- heating limited by cost, post- set by desired temp)
[line of enquiry - add model constraints on cost and temp and vary both constraints to see what output looks like. Type of billing cud impact heating behaviour e.g. all included in rent vs pay own bills.]
* Reduction factor NOT directly linked to house income.


Measuring Comfort Factor
={\textgreater} not all studies differentiate between Comfort Factor and Reduciton factor (i.e. assume that ALL discrepancy is due to increased user consumption thru higher temp)
* Need to measure internal temp before hand (cf Warm Front study)
* Adding cavity wall insulation has different impact to others (increases radiant temp)
* Some studies show CF increasing with time-{\textgreater}dynamic of behaviour change
* Significant link to fuel use before retro (like for RF)


Methods
* Compare expected vs observed intern temp vs heat loss. (doesn't need to measure power in, but large std err)
* Before and after consumption use std heating patterns/BREDEM model, and compare when using measured temps in BREDEM model.


={\textgreater} Consider looking at Warmfront Energy Report data




{\#} Other Factor (diff not accounted for by temp increase)


* Insulation in practise vs theory
* BREDEM model of ventilation may be wrong - lack of data. Assumes insulation (except cavity) doesn't effect airtightness
* Use of unmetered fuels (lamps, burners)
* BREDEM validated for large studies, not so much individual (fine with me :)


{\#} Analysis
* Need to factor in hot water use
* Corrections for outdoor temp - approve of forumla in 2.6.5.2
* Need to measure indoor temp, consider location and time of measurement (different temps in livingroom, bedroom, halls etc)


Comfort taking-{\textgreater} radient temp used by people to assess indoor temp, changes which effect it (cavity wall, double glaze) have special impact.




Recommendations
Need a large scale survey before and after (500+) to estimate statistical reduction factor. Main difficulty is that while we can monitor energy consumption and apply insulation to big cohort, size means probably no monitoring of internal temperature


Small, detailed survery (100ish) (hope to make it scalable so details apply to large scale). Need detailed energy monitoring (not just yearly estimates). Internal temp monitoring. External weather monitoring. BREDEM model if possible. Be able to separate heating use from overall energy consumption.


Need to think about what the sample size required to measure a given effect is. Do some statistical analysis


Best method for estimating comfort factor so far appears to be using BREDEM to estimate energy cost of higher internal temp and comparing to results.

Comments
---------
Interesting attempt to do cross analysis of data, methods, and costs.
Show mostly that there is a big spread across the methods
Techniques to study different payback levels (profit/loss) are a bit weak - get general gist but not very meaty comparison.


General gist is that depending on combination of energy saving calc method, cost estimation method, and financial indicator you get very different result.






Intro
----


French policy {\~{}}400 000 need for retrofit each year for 38{\%} reduction of home energy consumption
Also 23{\%} renewable, including building integrated


Retrofits are generally NOT driven by profitability - most profitable work often not the one done.
BUT still makes sense to study from profitability perpective.
Also identify financial incentives


Lack of studies with BOTH cost and energy savings - so use data from several sources. Only common source found is French EPC, results not v. accurate


Method
------


Case study of homes 1948-75, oil fuel, N. France


Cover 3 envelope actions
- single-{\textgreater} double glazed
- loft insulation (when None before)
- internal wall insulation
2 heating actions
- gas boiler
- high temp heat pump (COP 2.5 due to building requirements, small old radiators need high temp)
- solar panels for domestic hot water (SDHW)




Examine several methods for estimating savings


Field studies - CEREN 2008-a {\&} -b has database about oil boiler buildings


Enhanced Engineering Estimate - energy saving calc from change in U value, including HDD and rebound effect AND "discrepancy coefficient" for "bad workmanship"
Rebound effect: studied but no consensus
Discrepancy set to 0.8 from Hong thesis (have big doubts about this - hong was case study, hard to generalize. Important sinces this is a 20{\%} delta, which is in similar range to size of expected savings! So if it's wrong can fuck a lot up!)




French White certificate uses formula like EEE above but w. out rebounds and DE


French EPC method is standardized


French Th-C-E 2005 for thermal regulation uses hourly simulation and U21W05 software




{\#}{\#} Costs
lack of data
cost of material, cost of extra gear, labour, hidden cost (generally hard to include, things like post install cleanup/decorating etc)


Data exists in French EPC (??) in technical guidance


Batiprix for french market, standard building goods costs


Costs from case studies from ANAH




Financial indicators
----------------
Calculate with discounting - generally very high for housholds but use low rate to be in line with value used by policy


Use short 10 year time as that is closer to expected/desired short payback times in residential






{\#}{\#} Cost of saved energy
from normative calcuation from economic ministry, calculated as cost of action divded by energy saving with discounting




Results
------
Big spread of results depending on method
EPC gives highest estimates of energy savings!
Field study and EEE give smallest


Goes over what are big, small, close to expected but doesn't conclusively show that results are what they are for a reason rather than by accident. E.g. the FWC method based on a synthetic calculation lands in the middle, but is that because the method is better or it just happens to use moderate coeffs.},

abstract = {Estimates of daily electrical cooling load for a city of 800,000 are developed based on the relationship between weather variables and daily-average electricity consumption over 1 year. The relationship is found to be nearly linear above a threshold temperature. Temperature and humidity were found to be the largest, at 59{\%}, and second largest, at 21{\%}, contributors to electrical cooling load. Direct normal irradiation intercepted by a vertical cylinder, DNIsin$\theta$, was found to be a useful explanatory variable when modeling aggregates of buildings without a known or dominant orientation. The best study case model used DNIsin$\theta$ and diffuse horizontal irradiation (DHI) as distinct explanatory variables with annual electrical cooling load contributions of 9{\%} and 11{\%} respectively. Although the seasonal variation in electrical cooling load is large – on peak summer days more than 1.5 times the winter base load – the combined direct and diffuse solar contribution is essentially flat through the year, a condition at odds with the common assumption that solar cooling always provides a good match between supply and demand. The final model gives an electrical cooling load estimate for Abu Dhabi Island that corresponds to 40{\%} of the total annual electrical load and 61{\%} on the peak day.},

Notes:
Dude this is awesome. Clear, precise, and to the point.


Intro
----


Hypothesis - consumers can be described by a small number of groups of consumption patterns. patterns explained by house characterisitcs, appliances, behaviours.


Method
------
Clustering of Power Demand Distributions
Remove assumption of normality for energy demand
={\textgreater} interesting to consider w.r.t. PTG - still making strong assumptions, could ditch them by analysing dayly data with ML algo


Mine patterns in distributions using Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test (presumably to decide whether pattern fits into one group or not) - calculate a K-S distance metric d{\_}KS


After, use multinomial logit to figure out what characteristics determin the group by using results of an extensive survey as an input.


Selecting number of clusters done by observing level above which clustering quality/performance doesnt increase




Benefit - calculate the cost of energy at a given time using simplified market model with estimation of optimum advance purchase. Realize that different shapes of demand have different costs of service because cost of energy varies (especially if you are selling at fixed rate but have to buy at cariable rate




Similarity - consider users similar if user 1 consumption dist X, user 2 Y, Y = aX+b (scale and shift) - essentially the same shape but could be different absolute values
={\textgreater} also interesting wrt PTG or other more complex fit models.


Need to decide if X and Y are similar - if you assumed gaussian could just use mu and sigma, but they aren't (otherwise you wouldnt identify different classes) so use K-S stat.


Formula to calculate distance based on KS stat with scale and shift parameter search.




Cluster using K Medians (rather than K means) - cluster using statistical distribution distance instead of euclidean distance




Performance optimization based on literature in assignement and classification steps




Dataset - actually quite small, apparently just one week minimum!. Large accompanying survey.




Results
------
Large appliances like driers and AC are major determinants of PDD class, behaviour less so.},

This study introduces a lower cost alternative to estimate the ELA using inverse modeling approach. EnergyPlus. Monitored energy consumption data from the building is then used as the target value for the calibration. It is well known that the stochastic nature of weather, occupant behavior, infiltration and the physical aspects of building components have a strong impact on building energy consumption. Unfortunately, these uncertainties are usually ignored in a deterministic simulation such as EnergyPlus.

abstract = {In the UK, there is mounting evidence that the measured in situ performance of the building fabric in new build dwellings can be greater than that predicted, resulting in a significant building fabric ‘performance gap'. This paper presents the coheating test results from 25 new build dwellings built to Part L1A 2006 or better. Whilst the total number of dwellings reported here is small, the results suggest that a substantial ‘performance gap' can exist between the predicted and measured performance of the building fabric, with the measured whole building U value being just over 1.6 times greater than that predicted. This is likely to have significant implications in terms of the energy use and CO2 emissions attributable to these dwellings in use. Practical application : This paper describes an aggregate approach (coheating test) that has been applied to a small sample of dwellings to quantify the size of the ‘performance gap'. The results suggest that this ‘gap' can be large ({\textgreater}100{\%}) and can vary depending upon form and construction type. The results also illustrate the importance of developing a larger, more representative whole dwelling heat loss data set. This could be used by industry to apply a suitable performance factor (note 1) to the nominal performance of new build that accounts for the ‘performance gap'. This factor could be specific to form and main construction type.},

The co-heating test comprises a quasi-stationary heating experiment followed by linear regression analysis of aggregated building performance data. This paper reviews related research work and cristallises the current state-of-the-art. The physical phenomena working behind the scenes of the generally assumed simplified heat balance are discussed. Statistical constraints generally prevent these from being uncovered fully during the analysis.

Simulations predict that a significant amount of energy can be saved on heating, cooling and lighting of buildings in places such as Madrid by using this switchable IR reflector. We have also fabricated a switchable IR reflector which can also generate electricity. These polymer based switchable IR reflectors are of high potential as windows of automobiles and buildings to control interior temperatures and save energy.},

abstract = {In the European Union, the building sector is one of the largest energy consumer with about 40{\%} of the final energy consumption. Reducing consumption is also a sociological, technological and scientific matter. New methods have to be devised in order to support building professionals in their effort to optimize designs and to enhance energy performances. Indeed, the research field related to building modelling and energy performances prediction is very productive, involving various scientific domains. Among them, one can distinguish physics-related fields, focusing on the resolution of equations simulating building thermal behaviour and mathematics-related ones, consisting in the implementation of prediction model thanks to machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a detailed review and discussion of these works. First, the approaches based on physical (“white box”) models are reviewed according three-category classification. Then, we present the main machine learning (“black box”) tools used for prediction of energy consumption, heating/cooling demand, indoor temperature. Eventually, a third approach called hybrid (“grey box”) method is introduced, which uses both physical and statistical techniques. The paper covers a wide range of research works, giving the base principles of each technique and numerous illustrative examples.},

abstract = {This article reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aiming to encourage households to reduce energy consumption. Thirty-eight studies performed within the field of (applied) social and environmental psychology are reviewed, and categorized as involving either antecedent strategies (i.e. commitment, goal setting, information, modeling) or consequence strategies (i.e. feedback, rewards). Particular attention is given to the following evaluation criteria: (1) to what extent did the intervention result in behavioral changes and/or reductions in energy use, (2) were underlying behavioral determinants examined (e.g. knowledge, attitudes), (3) to what extent could effects be attributed to the interventions and, (4) were effects maintained over longer periods of time? Interestingly, most studies focus on voluntary behavior change, by changing individual knowledge and/or perceptions rather than changing contextual factors (i.e. pay-off structure) which may determine households' behavioral decisions. Interventions have been employed with varying degrees of success. Information tends to result in higher knowledge levels, but not necessarily in behavioral changes or energy savings. Rewards have effectively encouraged energy conservation, but with rather short-lived effects. Feedback has also proven its merits, in particular when given frequently. Some important issues cloud these conclusions, such as methodological problems. Also, little attention is given to actual environmental impact of energy savings. Often, an intervention's effectiveness is studied without examining underlying psychological determinants of energy use and energy savings. Also, it is not always clear whether effects were maintained over a longer period of time. Recommendations are given to further improve intervention planning and to enhance the effectiveness of interventions.},

abstract = {Proper daylighting designs in interior spaces may reduce the energy costs of electric lighting and improve the productivity of occupants. This paper reports the potential advantages of a multifunctional complex fenestration system with embedded micro-mirrors in daylighting by simulation. The system consists of a polymer layer with an array of embedded parabolic micro-mirrors, which was attached to a glass pane of glazing. By appropriate geometrical design, the embedded micro-mirrors may combine the function of keeping a clear view through the glazing due to the microscopic size of the embedded mirrors, and improving daylighting quality and quantity because of the redirection of daylight by micro-mirrors. In order to fully explore the potential advantages of the daylighting system with embedded micro-mirrors, three configurations were investigated: micro-mirrors in the upper third of a double glazing, micro-mirrors in the upper two-thirds of a double glazing and micro-mirrors in the whole glazing. Metrics based on illuminance, uniformity, glare and directivity were used to assess daylight performance for a south-facing fa??ade in Lausanne (46??30'N and longitude 6??37'E), Switzerland. Compared with a standard low-e double glazing, the daylighting system with micro-mirrors could induce more daylight in the rear of a room and improve the uniformity of the daylight distribution. By integrating micro-mirrors in the upper two-thirds of the glazing, the risk of glare was reduced for a sightline parallel to the glazing on the spring equinox and on the winter solstice. For the case with micro-mirrors in the whole glazing, the directivity of daylight along the depth of the room was significantly improved from the harsh range to the preferred range at noon, suggesting a comfortable visual situation.},

abstract = {Am 25. Mai 2011 hat der Bundesrat den schrittweisen Ausstieg aus der Kernenergie beschlossen und die Energiestrategie 2050 skizziert. Hierbei geht es unter anderem darum, auch langfristig die Energieversorgungssicherheit der Schweiz zu gew{\"{a}}hrleis- ten bzw. weiter zu st{\"{a}}rken sowie die Auswirkungen verschiedener Entwicklungsoptio- nen f{\"{u}}r das Energiesystem unter den Aspekten Wirtschaftlichkeit, Umweltvertr{\"{a}}glich- keit / Nachhaltigkeit sowie Versorgungssicherheit zu untersuchen. Aufbauend auf den Energieperspektiven 2007, deren Zeithorizont bis zum Jahr 2035 reichte, werden f{\"{u}}r die Energieperspektiven 2050 die sozio{\"{o}}konomischen Rahmenda- ten aufdatiert, die technischen Voraussetzungen aktualisiert und neue energiepoliti- sche Entwicklungen ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt. Auf dieser Basis wurden drei Szenarien zur Ent- wicklung von Energienachfrage und Energieangebot f{\"{u}}r die Schweiz erarbeitet. Die Eckszenarien „Weiter wie bisher“ sowie „Neue Energiepolitik“ sind in der grunds{\"{a}}tzli- chen Anlage von den Szenarien I und IV der Energieperspektiven 2007 abgeleitet. Je- doch sind sie aufgrund der seitherigen Ver{\"{a}}nderungen, sowohl in den sozio{\"{o}}konomi- schen, politischen als auch technischen Rahmenbedingungen, in Details und in den quantitativen Entwicklungen nicht „eins zu eins“ {\"{u}}bertragbar. Das Szenario „Politische Massnahmen“ ist ein politisch getriebenes Instrumentensze- nario. Eine besondere Rolle spielt dabei die k{\"{u}}nftige Stromversorgung vor dem Hinter- grund des auch in der Schweiz geplanten Ausstiegs aus der Kernenergie. Es werden mehrere Varianten zur Deckung des Strombedarfs untersucht. Die {\"{o}}konomischen Kon- sequenzen der unterschiedlichen energiewirtschaftlichen Szenarien werden vom Pro- jektpartner Ecoplan ermittelt. Eine weitere Schnittstelle besteht zu einem Projekt, das die Auswirkungen auf das Stromnetz absch{\"{a}}tzt (Consentec). Zus{\"{a}}tzlich wird eine Rei- he von vertiefenden Exkursen zu Auswirkungen wachsender Anteile fluktuierender erneuerbarer Energien im Strommix, W{\"{a}}rme-Kraft-Kopplung, Elektromobilit{\"{a}}t sowie Biomassepotenzialen ausgearbeitet. Die Arbeit vertieft die „Schnellschuss-Arbeit“ zur Begleitung des Kernenergieausstiegs mit {\"{u}}ber 40 Szenarien-Variantenkombinationen, die im April-/Mai 2011 durchgef{\"{u}}hrt wurde. Die Szenarien wurden mit dem bekannten und in Kap. 2 beschriebenen Bottom-up- Instrumentarium komplett neu berechnet. Der Sektor Verkehr wird hierbei von Infras AG Bern bearbeitet. Aufgrund der zahlreichen aktualisierten Rahmendaten, der Kern- kraftwerkslaufzeiten sowie der Anpassung an aktuelle Technologieentwicklungen so- wie schnell diffundierende Innovationen (vor allem im Bereich der I{\&}K-Technologien, die auch beginnen, Konsumpr{\"{a}}ferenzen und -wege zu ver{\"{a}}ndern) ergeben sich damit z. T. deutliche Ver{\"{a}}nderungen gegen{\"{u}}ber den im Mai 2011 ver{\"{o}}ffentlichten Zwischen- ergebnissen der aggregierten Rechnungen. Insofern handelt es sich nicht mehr nur um Aufdatierungen der Energieperspektiven 2035, sondern um einen eigenst{\"{a}}ndigen ak- tualisierten Szenarienf{\"{a}}cher. Es ist nicht Aufgabe der Energieszenarien, Handlungsempfehlungen f{\"{u}}r die Politik ab- zuleiten oder eine Bewertung verschiedener politischer Strategien vorzunehmen. Die Szenarien stellen eine quantitative Untersuchung dar, mit der die Auswirkungen von Rahmenbedingungen, Einflussfaktoren, politischen Eingriffen und Zielsetzungen auf Energieverbrauch, CO2-Emissionen und Versorgungssicherheit aufgezeigt und vergli- chen werden k{\"{o}}nnen. Ihre Aufgabe ist es, eine quantitative Grundlage f{\"{u}}r die politische und gesellschaftliche Diskussion bereit zu stellen.},

abstract = {The UK Government estimates that approximately 22 TWh of energy can be saved from English dwellings by 2020 from a range of fabric and heating energy efficiency retrofits. Yet the rate of retrofit uptake has been less than is needed to meet government targets and the retrofits impact on energy demand has been less than predicted. Two questions that must be addressed are: who have (and have not) taken up retrofits and what household factors affect this; and, what impact have these retrofits had on energy use and how does this differ among households. The purpose of this study is to provide a better understanding of the uptake of energy efficiency retrofits and the resulting change in energy demand. A cohort of 168,998 dwellings gas-heated English dwellings was used to examine retrofit uptake from 2002 to 2007 and the change in gas use from 2005 to 2007. The findings show that retrofits do have an attributable impact on reducing energy demand and that combining retrofits displays a dose-response like effect, after controlling for household and dwelling factors. Energy savings play a central role in meeting UK climate change mitigation targets and therefore understanding the take up of energy efficiency retrofits and their impact on energy demand and variations in these retrofits across the population is vital to understand their potential.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between occupant behaviors and building energy consumption is one of the most effective ways to bridge the gap between predicted and actual energy consumption in buildings. However effective methodologies to remove the impact of other variables on building energy consumption and isolate the leverage of the human factor precisely are still poorly investigated. Moreover, the effectiveness of statistical and data mining approaches in finding meaningful correlations in data is largely undiscussed in literature. This study develops a framework combining statistical analysis with two data-mining techniques, cluster analysis and association rules mining, to identify valid window operational patterns in measured data. Analyses are performed on a data set with measured indoor and outdoor physical parameters and human interaction with operable windows in 16 offices. Logistic regression was first used to identify factors influencing window opening and closing behavior. Clustering procedures were employed to obtain distinct behavioral patterns, including motivational, opening duration, interactivity and window position patterns. Finally the clustered patterns constituted a base for association rules segmenting the window opening behaviors into two archetypal office user profiles for which different natural ventilation strategies as well as robust building design recommendations that may be appropriate. Moreover, discerned working user profiles represent more accurate input to building energy modeling programs, to investigate the impacts of typical window opening behavior scenarios on energy use, thermal comfort and productivity in office buildings.},

abstract = {Recurrence-plot–based time series analysis is widely used to study changes and transitions in the dynamics of a system or temporal deviations from its overall dynamical regime. However, most studies do not discuss the significance of the detected variations in the recurrence quantification measures. In this letter we propose a novel method to add a confidence measure to the recurrence quantification analysis. We show how this approach can be used to study significant changes in dynamical systems due to a change in control parameters, chaos-order as well as chaos-chaos transitions. Finally we study and discuss climate transitions by analysing a marine proxy record for past sea surface temperature. This paper is dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the introduction of recurrence plots.},

abstract = {The Green Deal is a major new energy policy designed to support the diffusion of energy efficiency measures in UK homes. This paper provides one of the first empirical examinations of the Green Deal′s success in influencing homeowners' renovation decisions. Using a repeated measures design in which households were questioned before and after the Green Deal′s launch in January 2013, we assess the policy′s success in raising awareness of energy efficiency. In particular, we test the effectiveness of the Green Deal′s positioning to overcome barriers to renovation among homeowners already interested in or considering energy efficiency measures. Using the innovation decision process (Rogers, 2003) as a conceptual framing of the renovation decision process, we examine whether new information on energy efficiency provided by the Green Deal strengthened intentions and its antecedents. We find that (1) energy efficiency is of potential appeal to all renovators regardless of their attitudes about energy efficiency, (2) energy efficiency opportunities need to be identified in the early stages of renovation when homeowners are thinking about ways to improve their home, and (3) homeowners' intentions towards energy efficiency are weakened by uncertainty about financial benefits, helping to explain the relatively slow uptake of the Green Deal to-date.},

abstract = {Repeated surveys of occupant control of the indoor environment were carried out in Danish dwellings from September to October 2006 and again from February to March 2007. The summer survey comprised 933 respondents and the winter survey 636 respondents. The surveys were carried out by sending out invitations to addresses obtained from a Danish register along with information on dwelling characteristics. Meteorological data was obtained from the Danish Meteorological Institute. Four control mechanisms (window open/closed, heating on/off, lighting on/off and solar shading in/not in use) were analysed separately by means of multiple logistic regression in order to quantify factors influencing occupants' behaviour. The window opening behaviour was strongly related to the outdoor temperature. The perception of the environment and factors concerning the dwelling also impacted the window opening behaviour. The proportion of dwellings with the heating turned on was strongly related to the outdoor temperature and the presence of a wood burning stove. The solar radiation, dwelling ownership conditions and the perception of the indoor environment also affected the use of heating. The results of the statistical analyses form a basis for a definition of standard behaviour patterns which can be used to make calculation of energy consumption of buildings more accurate.},

abstract = {Due to the growth of electric end-uses, the management of the variations in time of the electric power demand has become essential, especially in the residential sector. According to this issue, the anticipation of the power demand is of great interest. This implies a better knowledge of the electric load curve of the household stock. Papers about understanding and forecasting energy demand are numerous but studies on buildings load curves are rare. In this paper we propose a cross analysis of some existing methods capable of building up a residential electric load curve. Two main types of load curve models have been identified in the literature: top-down and bottom-up methods. Even if the review presents two existing top-down approaches, the authors focused the further analysis on bottom-up models. For each of them we first identify its functional characteristics: finality and scope, input data required, output format, modeled appliances and end-uses covered, generation of the diversity and validation of the model. Secondly, we establish a bloc diagram representing its architecture with focus on the mathematical model chosen. Finally, the authors list the limits of the model in view of the criteria needed to build up an ideal, bottom-up and technically explicit load curve model for the residential sector. A cross reading of the different methodologies is proposed through a global table that characterizes and sums up the analyzed models. Moreover, a graphical representation of the models studied is proposed, according to three criteria (range of application, modelling of the diversity, time scale accuracy) that allows us to compare them at a glance. To conclude, an identification of the gaps among existing models is proposed. It consists of listing the end-uses, the appliances and other behavioural correlations which may affect the load curve and that are not included in the reviewed methodologies and need further research. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In general, only measurements of the global radiation are known, but for many applications diffuse and direct fractions are also needed. For this reason, many models have been devel- oped to establish correlations between the diffuse fraction and various predictors. However, at present, no reliable model which could be applied to worldwide stations, in particular to Swiss Alps, has been found. The first purpose of this work is to gather radiation data from Swiss and worldwide sta- tions with different geographical and climate conditions. The second goal is to present an overview of the different decomposition models and their limitations. The third goal, the most important part, is to test four models - Reindl-Helbig, Skartveit and Olseth, Boland- Ridley-Lauret and Maxwell - on a dataset with one-hour time steps. The model proposed by Skartveit and Olseth is overall performing best, especially on data with a high clearness index. It is shown that these models are poorly performing on three polar stations, where solar elevations are constantly low. This behavior reflects the limitation of the models on the estimation of the diffuse fraction for solar elevations lower than 30 ◦. Furthermore, a model was developed by Perez on the basis of that of Maxwell. Applying a completely new method, D¨ urr proposed a further model. An analysis on those two addi- tional models was conducted. Potential predictors and adequate model structures are discussed: the clearness index kt and solar altitude have been found to be significant predictors. A candidate for a universal model should include a variability index, because of the temporal weather evolution. Air mass and and aerosols have also to be considered, as they contain information about the atmospheric composition. Finally, the models were performed on different time basis. For a smaller time interval, there is an increased variability of the data, but the performance still remains acceptable.},

abstract = {A large-scale continuous campaign management model-based approach that places value on variables that are broad, difficult to measure, and changing with time (from the perspective of behavioral change) does not exist at this time of writing. This research seeks to identify a model-based approach to continuously optimize an energy efficiency campaign. A literature review of traditional approaches to campaign management finds that behavioral variables, as well as economic variables, are important in campaign design, and that these types of campaigns need to be up-scaled and applied to a broad audience. A literature review of models is completed within the categories of measurement and verification, behavioral change campaigns, project management, and strategic management to identify an approach to continuous campaign management. Determined to be the best approach for the current research, the balanced scorecard (Kaplan and Norton 1992) is adapted to a campaign perspective. Through seven expert interviews, the proposed approach is applied to seven campaigns in operation. Expert feedback of the proposed approach is recorded and compared with literature theory to gain understanding of gaps between the two. The largest gap is identified in the management of learning and innovation, both in theory and practice. Finally, an updated approach is presented based on expert feedback, and an extension of the current approach is offered by the author for future research. Clay},

abstract = {Technology policies are one of the options available for the reduction of carbon emissions and the usage of energy. However, gains in the efficiency of energy consumption will result in an effective reduction in the per unit price of energy services. As a result, consumption of energy services should increase (i.e., “rebound” or “take-back”), partially offsetting the impact of the efficiency gain in fuel use. Definitions of the “rebound” effect vary in the literature and among researchers. Depending on the boundaries used for the effect, the size or magnitude of this behavioral response may vary. This review of some of the relevant literature from the US offers definitions and identifies sources including direct, secondary, and economy-wide sources. We then offer a summary of the available empirical evidence for the effect for various sources. For the energy end uses for which studies are available, we conclude that the range of estimates for the size of the rebound effect is very low to moderate.},

abstract = {Sensing, monitoring and actuating systems are expected to play a key role in reducing buildings overall energy consumption. Leveraging sensor systems to support energy efficiency in buildings poses novel research challenges in monitoring space usage, controlling devices, interfacing with smart energy meters and communicating with the energy grid. In the attempt of reducing electricity consumption in buildings, identifying individual sources of energy consumption is key to generate energy awareness and improve efficiency of available energy resources usage. Previous work studied several non-intrusive load monitoring techniques to classify appliances; however, the literature lacks of an comprehensive system that can be easily installed in existing buildings to empower users profiling, benchmarking and recognizing loads in real-time. This has been a major reason holding back the practice adoption of load monitoring techniques. In this paper we present RECAP: RECognition of electrical Appliances and Profiling in real-time. RECAP uses a single wireless energy monitoring sensor easily clipped to the main electrical unit. The energy monitoring unit transmits energy data wirelessly to a local machine for data processing and storage. The RECAP system consists of three parts: (1) Guiding the user for profiling electrical appliances within premises and generating a database of unique appliance signatures; (2) Using those signatures to train an artificial neural network that is then employed to recognize appliance activities (3) Providing a Load descriptor to allow peer appliance benchmarking. RECAP addresses the need of an integrated and intuitive tool to empower building owners with energy awareness. Enabling real-time appliance recognition is a stepping-stone towards reducing energy consumption and allowing a number of major applications including load-shifting techniques, energy expenditure breakdown per appliance, detection of power hungry and faulty appliances, and recogn- - ition of occupant activity. This paper describes the system design and performance evaluation in domestic environment.},

The first method is the engineering model, which has been used to calculate the so far only documented Norwegian end-use results applied on data from a Norwegian energy survey. The second method is an econometric conditional demand model applied on data from the same survey.

These were laminated to 3 mm thick clear glass or commercially available SnO2 based heat mirror coating of sheet resistance 15 ?? on float glass of 3mm thickness using a poly(ethylene vinyl acetate), EVA, sheet of 0.36mm thickness in a vacuum process at 120??C for 30 min. In total, the thickness of the glazing was 6.35mm. The glazings possess visible transmittance, weighted for D65 solar spectra and sensitivity of the human eye for daylight vision, of 36{\%} or 14{\%} with solar absorptance of 71{\%} or 78{\%} depending on the coating type, i.e ZnS-CuS or ZnS-Bi2S 3-CuS-heat mirror respectively. The solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) was evaluated for these glazings at exterior temperatures of 15 and 32??C for an exterior convective heat transfer coefficient (hex) of 6-100Wm-2K-1 using a mathematical model. The model predicts the extent of reduction in SHGC through the presence of the heat mirror coating as a function of hex and hence helps to decide on the relative benefit, which may be derived through their use in different locations. Though the deposition technique mentioned here involves longer duration compared with vacuum techniques, it may be developed into a low throughput, low-capital alternate technology for small-scale production. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a method that can be applied to hourly whole-house electrical energy data to partially disaggregate total household electricity use into five load categories/parameters (base load, activity load, heating season gradient, cooling season gradient and lowest external temperature at which air-conditioning is used). This paper develops the proposed method, and verifies it using high-resolution end-use data from twelve households with known characteristics. We then apply the method to hourly whole-house (smart meter) data from 327 households in Ontario. The roll-out of smart (advanced) metering infrastructure in many countries will make hourly whole-house data abundant, and we propose that this method could be widely applied by utilities to target their demand-side management programs towards households more likely to provide benefits, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of such programs.},

abstract = {The world appears to be emerging from the worst economic crisis in decades. Many countries have made pledges under the Copenhagen Accord to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Commitments have also been made by the G-20 and APEC to phase out inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies. Are we, at last, on the path to a secure, reliable and environmentally sustainable energy system? Updated projections of energy demand, production, trade and investment, fuel by fuel and region by region to 2035 are provided in the 2010 edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO). It includes, for the first time, a new scenario that anticipates future actions by governments to meet the commitments they have made to tackle climate change and growing energy insecurity. WEO-2010 shows: {\textperiodcentered} what more must be done and spent to achieve the goal of the Copenhagen Accord to limit the global temperature increase to 2°C and how these actions would impact on oil markets; {\textperiodcentered} how emerging economies – led by China and India – will increasingly shape the global energy landscape; {\textperiodcentered} what role renewables can play in a clean and secure energy future; {\textperiodcentered} what removing fossil-fuel subsidies would mean for energy markets, climate change and state budgets; {\textperiodcentered} the trends in Caspian energy markets and the implications for global energy supply; {\textperiodcentered} the prospects for unconventional oil; and {\textperiodcentered} how to give the entire global population access to modern energy services. With extensive data, projections and analysis, WEO-2010 provides invaluable insights into how the energy system could evolve over the next quarter of a century. The book is essential reading for anyone with a stake in the energy sector.},

abstract = {Green roofs are a passive cooling technique that stop incoming solar radiation from reaching the building structure below. Many studies have been conducted over the past 10 years to consider the potential building energy benefits of green roofs and shown that they can offer benefits in winter heating reduction as well as summer cooling. This paper reviews the current literature and highlights the situations in which the greatest building energy savings can be made. Older buildings with poor existing insulation are deemed to benefit most from a green roof as current building regulations require such high levels of insulation that green roofs are seen to hardly affect annual building energy consumption. As over half of the existing UK building stock was built before any roof insulation was required, it is older buildings that will benefit most from green roofs. The case for retrofitting existing buildings is therefore reviewed and it is found there is strong potential for green roof retrofit in the UK.},

abstract = {In 1997 the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology (JCGM), chaired by the Director of the BIPM, was formed by the seven International Organizations that had prepared the original versions of the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM) and the International vocabulary of basic and general terms in metrology (VIM). The Joint Committee took on this part of the work of the ISO Technical Advisory Group 4 (TAG 4), which had developed the GUM and the VIM. The Joint Committee was originally made up of representatives from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML). In 2005, the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) officially joined the seven founding international organizations. The JCGM has two Working Groups. Working Group 1 (JCGM/WG 1) on the GUM has the task of promoting the use of the GUM and preparing Supplements to the GUM for broad application. Working Group 2 (JCGM/WG 2) on the VIM has the task of revising the VIM and promoting its use. Working Group 2 is composed of up to two representatives of each member organization, supplemented by a limited number of experts. The third edition of the VIM has been prepared by Working Group 2. In 2004, a first draft of the third edition of the VIM was submitted for comments and proposals to the eight organizations represented in the JCGM, which in most cases consulted their members or affiliates, including numerous National Metrology Institutes. Comments were studied and discussed, taken into account when appropriate, and replied to by JCGM/WG 2. A final draft of the third edition was submitted in 2006 to the eight organizations for review and approval. All subsequent comments were considered and taken into account as appropriate by Working Group 2. The third edition of the VIM has been approved by each and all of the eight JCGM Member organizations. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition 1993.},

abstract = {Like all industrialised countries, Belgium accepted to diminish its greenhouse gas emissions in the frame of the Kyoto agreement. On top of the list figures CO2. A major emission source for CO2 is burning fossil fuels. As the residential sector accounts for 28{\%} of the country's annual energy consumption and as this consumption mainly concerns fossil fuels, it has an equally important share in the CO2 release. Hence, at first sight, the best policy for a decrease is by improving the energy efficiency. The question to be solved, however, is which improvement could generate the reduction needed? This study discusses a methodology and comments simulations that help in answering that question. The results are not as simple as one should like. The housing stock in fact acts as a conservatory system. For the case being, the impact of energy efficient new construction on the CO2 release remains quite marginal if the period considered does not extend beyond a decade. The effect becomes significant only over a longer period, on condition that more stringent energy efficiency measures are combined with a shift from new construction to retrofit and reconstruction. Also a diminishing increase in the number of households may help in reducing energy consumption and CO2 release.},

abstract = {Traditional whole building energy modeling suffers from several factors, including the large number of inputs required for building characterization, simplifying assumptions, and the gap between the as-designed and as-built building. Prior work has attempted to mitigate these problems by using sensor-based machine learning approaches to statistically model energy consumption, applying the techniques primarily to commercial building data, which makes use of hourly consumption data. It is unclear, however, whether these techniques can translate to residential buildings, since the energy usage patterns may vary significantly. Until now, most residential modeling research only had access to monthly electrical consumption data. In this article, we report on the evaluation of seven different machine learning algorithms applied to a new residential data set that contains sensor measurements collected every 15min, with the objective of determining which techniques are most successful for predicting next hour residential building consumption. We first validate each learner's correctness on the ASHRAE Great Energy Prediction Shootout, confirming existing conclusions that Neural Network-based methods perform best on commercial buildings. However, our additional results show that these methods perform poorly on residential data, and that Least Squares Support Vector Machines perform best – a technique not previously applied to this domain.},

abstract = {This study estimates the combined direct and indirect rebound effects from various types of energy efficiency improvement and behavioural change by UK households and explores how these effects vary with total expenditure. The methodology is based upon estimates of the expenditure elasticity and GHG intensity of 16 categories of goods and services, and allows for the capital cost and embodied emissions of the energy efficiency measures themselves. The study finds that rebound effects, in GHG terms, are modest (0-32{\%}) for measures affecting domestic energy use, larger (25-65{\%}) for measures affecting vehicle fuel use and very large (66-106{\%}) for measures that reduce food waste. Furthermore, measures undertaken by low income households are associated with the largest rebound effects, with direct emissions forming a larger proportion of the total rebound effect for those households. Measures that are subsidised or affect highly taxed energy commodities may be less effective in reducing aggregate emissions. These findings highlight the importance of allowing for rebound effects within policy appraisals, as well as reinforcing the case for economy-wide carbon pricing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {SAP/BREDEM-based models are commonly used for estimating national domestic energy consumption and for assessing the energy and environmental impacts of changes in the housing stock. However, policy-makers should recognize that such models are subject to multiple potential sources of uncertainty. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis is undertaken on the Cambridge Housing Model, a SAP 2009 model for estimating total domestic energy consumption in England and the UK. The analysis identifies several parameters to which the model is particularly sensitive, determines that the response to variations in individual parameters is typically non-linear, and concludes that changes to multiple parameters are not additive. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is then undertaken to provide an indication of the impact of multiple uncertainties on model outputs. A concept map is developed to outline a number of potential sources of uncertainty, and in the absence of reliable information expert judgement is used to describe these uncertainties. Outputs suggest that any single estimate of total consumption may be subject to considerable inaccuracy compared with actual use. Similar levels of uncertainty and inaccuracy are likely for any SAP/BREDEM-based national domestic energy model, such as the models underpinning the Green Deal. Des mod{\`{e}}les de type SAP/BREDEM sont couramment utilis{\'{e}}s pour estimer la consommation domestique nationale d'{\'{e}}nergie et pour {\'{e}}valuer les impacts {\'{e}}nerg{\'{e}}tiques et environnementaux des changements intervenant dans le parc b{\^{a}}ti. Cependant, les d{\'{e}}cideurs devraient reconna{\^{i}}tre que ces mod{\`{e}}les sont sujets {\`{a}} de multiples sources possibles d'incertitude. Une analyse de sensibilit{\'{e}} par l'approche One-At-A-Time (OAT) est entreprise sur le Mod{\`{e}}le Cambridge Housing, un mod{\`{e}}le SAP 2009 permettant d'estimer la consommation domestique totale d'{\'{e}}nergie en Angleterre et au Royaume-Uni. L'analyse identifie plusieurs param{\`{e}}tres auxquels le mod{\`{e}}le est particuli{\`{e}}rement sensible, d{\'{e}}termine que la r{\'{e}}ponse aux variations des param{\`{e}}tres individuels est habituellement non lin{\'{e}}aire et conclue que les modifications des param{\`{e}}tres multiples ne sont pas additives. Une analyse Monte-Carlo des incertitudes est ensuite entreprise pour fournir une indication de l'impact des incertitudes multiples sur les sorties du mod{\`{e}}le. Une carte conceptuelle est {\'{e}}labor{\'{e}}e pour exposer un certain nombre de sources possibles d'incertitude, et en l'absence d'informations fiables, un jugement d'expert est exerc{\'{e}} pour d{\'{e}}crire ces incertitudes.

However, policy-makers should recognize that such models are subject to multiple potential sources of uncertainty. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis is undertaken on the Cambridge Housing Model, a SAP 2009 model for estimating total domestic energy consumption in England and the UK. The analysis identifies several parameters to which the model is particularly sensitive, determines that the response to variations in individual parameters is typically non-linear, and concludes that changes to multiple parameters are not additive. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is then undertaken to provide an indication of the impact of multiple uncertainties on model outputs. A concept map is developed to outline a number of potential sources of uncertainty, and in the absence of reliable information expert judgement is used to describe these uncertainties. Outputs suggest that any single estimate of total consumption may be subject to considerable inaccuracy compared with actual use. Similar levels of uncertainty and inaccuracy are likely for any SAP/BREDEM-based national domestic energy model, such as the models underpinning the Green Deal.

Cambridge Housing Model (CHM) basis of UK modelling fed by English Housing Survey (EHS)


EHS - several hundred datapoints per dwelling. But not collected with modelling in mind.


This study uses 19° as basis temp instead of standard 21°


CHM best estimate of ttl domestic energy in 2009 = 445.3 TWh
Measured value is 417.6 TWh from scaling DUKES val (DECC 2011 -{\textgreater} might need this)
6.6{\%} diff with unknown uncertainty.


Sensitivity formula pg 158. Applied one at a time to 102 parameters.


={\textgreater} question: chose 1{\%}, why? is this "guaranteed small" for all the input parameters?


Test for linear scaling of output with changing inputs - some are linear, others not!


SPSS pronounces whether it's linear (ok i guess we trust it at this point... assuming it was used right :P)


Test of superposition - combined effect of two input variations equal to sum of effect of individual variations. Also does not always hold.


={\textgreater} Later, summarise which variables fuck up so you can look out for them in data work.


={\textgreater} Important! Highly sensitive to internal demand temperature. Which is quite variable, hard to pick apart demand and actual temperature.




Sources of uncertainty (see mind map showing proposed sources, pg161)


Monte carlo modelling by varying inputs - no correlation between buildings, correlation between certain internal values e.g. U values


Main source is probably raw data used to inform model - EHS survey, lots to go wrong. Assume normal distribution of input parameters.


SAP includes various assumed values like thermal bridge param. Appropriate distributions chosen for each. Some have high uncertainty ±50{\%} !


Uncertainty in temperature demand regimes (place where user has most input)
* Demand reported 19°C from 172 person survey. * Recorded mean thermostat 21.1°C from avg daily max living romm temp
={\textgreater} Note - not convinced this corresponds to demand setting - thermostats can heat during sunny spells, etc.
={\textgreater} Actually worse! Thermostats will result in temp overshoot as they try to stabilise around their set point. So if you take max temp you're going to have a +ive bias. Need better understanding of control response. Ask David about this.
={\textgreater} This is v. important to get right if there is a high energy sensitivity to internal temp/demand temp. Makes big difference to understanding if change in demand temp is result of tech properties of behaviour!
* Other studies measured 17.4°C to 18.9°C, also 19.1°C to 19.4°C
* Heating hrs from rec remp 8.3h/day, reported 9.5h/day


Went with 19°C avg, uncertainty 17.5-20.5°C, heating regime ±10{\%} in hrs


Quantifying intrinsic model uncertainty is hard (on top of input uncertainty) - use difference between predicted and measured energy use as proxy.


Use monte carlo to get estimate of ttl energy use and measure dist, compare to Normal, find it is not Normal ={\textgreater} negative skew},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine the effect of a major domestic energy efficiency refurbishment programme on domestic space heating fuel consumption. The case study dwellings were monitored either before or after (or both) the introduction of energy efficiency retrofit measures such as cavity wall insulation, loft insulation, draught stripping and energy efficient heating system. Property and utility consumption data were collected and half-hourly living room and main bedroom temperatures were monitored for 2–4 week period over two winters from a total of 1372 households selected from five major urban areas in England. Space heating fuel consumption was normalized to account for variation in the indoor–outdoor temperature difference and the dwelling floor area. The findings show that cavity wall and loft insulation can reduce the space heating fuel consumption by 10{\%} in centrally heated properties and 17{\%} in non-centrally heated properties. However, the introduction of a gas central heating system, although theoretically more efficient, has no significant impact in reducing fuel consumption even after adjusting for increased internal temperature.},
annote = {Before-after study, no rebound investigation




Warm Front based
Improve both energy efficiency and reduct fuel consumption.


Calculate savings based on model and from measured data
big differences
practical issues - lifting floorboards to put in central heating creates drafts, IR scans show gaps in insulation installation.




Calculations of modeled normalized space heating fuel consumption - see formula 1, 2,3..
Get parameters from survey or BREDEM (e.g. for N=background ventilation rate)


Have to estimate end use fuel consumption because monitoring exensive and difficult. Use bills minus estimated summer consumption from regression model built from 100 surveyed dwellings with summer bills.


Manage some disagregation of fuel consumption for given study:
71{\%} space heating
13{\%} water heating
12{\%} lighting and appliances
4{\%} cooking

UK domestic avg reported
62{\%}
23{\%}
12{\%}
3{\%}
={\textgreater} expect high space heating percent for WF priority intervention group


Hund {\&} Gidman study - bedroom NOT good indicator of zone 2 temp


So estimate zone 2 temp from bedroom temp and H{\&}G temp profiles for heating type


Calc room volumes from total house volume and typical dwelling room size distribution
- 28{\%} living room
11{\%} kitchen
15{\%} circulation
8{\%} bathroom
38{\%} bedroom




WF increase mean SAP score from 41 to 62 (UK avg 51)


20{\%} of post intervention still below average
={\textgreater} Would have been more interesting to look at IMPROVEMENT of SAP score - in terms of impact want to know if it worked, so would like to know {\%} of dwellings with big and small improvements


SAP does not seem to predict the normalised fuel consumption well at all!




Method accounted for take back effects though the normalized space heating fuel consumption
={\textgreater} IMPORTANT bit of method, easy to overlook: normalized fuel use for floor area AND heating degree days - Wh/K/m2/day


SINCE the degree days was calculated using a MEASURED internal tempature this already accounts for increase in mean internal temp (so-called comfort taking).
THEREFORE any discrepancies between expected and acheived energy needs to be accounted for in another way.


Possibilities:
Errors in calculation
Calculation of degree days depends on measuring internal temp. Initial calc used bedroom temp as zone 2. But as said, need to adjust because bedroom overestimates zone 2 temp. Causes big change in normalized fuel consumption
NB: H{\&}G study from 1976, ok because WF mostly for pre-1976 houses (though doesn't take possible changes in habits)


Model oversimiplifications:
V hard to estimate ventilation rates. Pressure tests found draft stripping didn't really work
20{\%} cavity wall insulation missing on IR cam inspection
13{\%} loft insulation missing in hard to reach areas


heating system efficiency based on lab tests not realy world, hard to estimate losses


Conclusions
----------
Temp improvements acheived OK, but fuel savings not really. heating system does little for savings, insulation does some but not as much as you want. partly related to nature of targeted dwellings.},

Being interested in dynamical properties of these astrophysically relevant orbits we employ rather novel approach based on the analysis of recurrences of the system to the vicinity of its previous states. We use recurrence plots (RPs) as a tool to visualize recurrences of the trajectory in the phase space. Construction of RPs is simple and straightforward regardless of the dimension of the phase space, which is a major advantage of this approach when compared to the "traditional" methods of the numerical analysis of dynamical systems (for instance the visual survey of Poincar$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}} surfaces of section, evaluation of the Lyapunov spectra etc.). We show that RPs and their quantitative measures (obtained from recurrence quantification analysis -- RQA) are powerful tools to detect dynamical regime of motion (regular vs. chaotic) and precisely locate the transitions between these regimes.},

abstract = {In this paper, we set out to develop a theoretical and conceptual framework for the new field of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience. This framework should be able to integrate insights from several relevant disciplines: theory on embodied cognition, ecological psychology, phenomenology, dynamical systems theory, and neurodynamics. We suggest that the main task of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience is to investigate the phenomenon of skilled intentionality from the perspective of the self-organization of the brain-body-environment system, while doing justice to the phenomenology of skilled action. In previous work, we have characterized skilled intentionality as the organism's tendency towards an optimal grip on multiple relevant affordances simultaneously. Affordances are possibilities for action provided by the environment. In the first part of this paper, we introduce the notion of skilled intentionality and the phenomenon of responsiveness to a field of relevant affordances. Second, we use Friston's work on neurodynamics, but embed a very minimal version of his Free Energy Principle in the ecological niche of the animal. Thus amended, this principle is helpful for understanding the embeddedness of neurodynamics within the dynamics of the brain-body-environment system. Next, we show how we can use this adjusted principle to understand the neurodynamics of selective openness to the environment: interacting action-readiness patterns at multiple timescales contribute to the organism's selective openness to relevant affordances. In the final part of the paper, we emphasize the important role of metastable dynamics in both the brain and the brain-body-environment system for adequate affordance-responsiveness. We exemplify our integrative approach by presenting research on the impact of Deep Brain Stimulation on affordance responsiveness of OCD patients.},

abstract = {With the rollout of smart metering infrastructure at scale, demand-response (DR) programs may now be tailored based on users' consumption patterns as mined from sensed data. For issuing DR events it is key to understand the inter-temporal consumption dynamics as to appropriately segment the user population. We propose to infer occupancy states from consumption time series data using a hidden Markov model framework. Occupancy is characterized in this model by 1) magnitude, 2) duration, and 3) variability. We show that users may be grouped according to their consumption patterns into groups that exhibit qualitatively different dynamics that may be exploited for program enrollment purposes. We investigate empirically the information that residential energy consumers' temporal energy demand patterns characterized by these three dimensions may convey about their demographic, household, and appliance stock characteristics. Our analysis shows that temporal patterns in the user's consumption data can predict with good accuracy certain user characteristics. We use this framework to argue that there is a large degree of individual predictability in user consumption at a population level.},

Smart meter segmentation w. focus on demand response







Issues/method problems



Very complex models used, e.g. 4th power weather models, risk of over fitting.
Very abstract approach that does really treat dwellings as continuous entities, with a many-many relation between occupancy states and dwellings. Underlying (but not very explicitly stated) understanding is that dwellings can be operated in a finite number of modes, each dwelling chooses a mode at a certain time. However large variation in modes and fact that you observe a large amount of variation suggests there are issues with this model. Or maybe that you better first split people into predictable and unpredictable ones (this is something that the recurrance plot idea addresses)},

The goal is to determine if other predictor variables, in addition to the clearness index, will significantly educe the standard error of Liu- and Jordan-type correlations (IdI = f(k1)). Stepwise regression is used to reduce a set of 28 potential predictor variables down to four significant predictors: the clearness index, solar altitude, ambient temperature, and relative humidity. A piecewise correlation over three ranges of clearness indices is developed to predict the diffuse fraction as a function of these four variables. A second piecewise correlation is developed for predicting the diffuse fraction as a function of the clearness index and solar altitude, for use when temperature and relative humidity are not available. A third piecewise correlation of the Liu- and Jordan-type is developed from the same data set. Comparing this correlation with the new correlations provides a direct measure of the value of added predictor variables. The full diffuse fraction correlation reduced the residual sum squares by 14{\%} when compared to the correlation that is a function of the clearness index only. The correlation including the clearness index and solar altitude diminished the residual sum squares by 9{\%}. The correlations exhibited some degree of location dependence. This is expected, as the climates are quite different. The correlations also showed some seasonal dependence; the errors are higher in the fall and winter than on an annual basis.},

@article{Deurinck2012,
abstract = {In the debate on predicting household energy savings, the temperature takeback – an increased indoor temperature after an energy efficient retrofit – is often blamed for offsetting part of the potential energy savings. Mostly, it is attributed to inhabitants grading up their heating behaviour to the lower energy cost after retrofit. However, even if inhabitants do not change their heating pattern, the indoor temperature will still rise after retrofit due to physical processes: warmer unheated zones and less temperature drop between two heating periods. This paper uses building energy simulation tools to assess the extent of these physical processes in the overall temperature rise. An existing terraced house is modelled and fictitious renovation measures are imposed, keeping the heating patterns unchanged. For the case analysed, a heating season mean indoor temperature rise of about 1°C is found, being in the same order of magnitude as empirically detected temperature changes. This suggests that the remaining behavioural aspect of the temperature takeback might be smaller than generally assumed. In addition, the comparison is made with a calculation method based on the EPBD regulation that does not take into account the physical temperature rise. The latter method overestimates the potential energy savings by about 6{\%}.},
annote = {comfort taking = temperature takeback


Take away - economic models blame users for increased temperatures but research (incl jennifer's) shows people don't think/act that way, temp change due to physical change not behaviour.


Purpose/question
---------------
blamed on users increasing temp
BUT insulation will normally increase internal temp anyway - warmer unheated areas, less leaks, temp does not drop as much between heating periods


Temperature takeback describes change in internal temperature, only a part of which can be ascribed to behaviour change.


* Large differences observed between expected and actual savings.


* Economic view - efficiency loss due to direct price rebound


* Little work on find what part is due to physical change of house (see above)
=={\textgreater} really interesting if you can get both measured temperature and set point temperature.


* indoor temperature has proven to be one of the predominant parame- ters on the energy consumption for space heating [9–11]


* Hard to use data to distinguish physical part - data is rare (my dataset may address that), hard to separate different components


Method
-------


modeling approach - build model and apply theoretical retrofits. Model in TRNSYS 17


find 1°C increase of mean temp without behavioural change.


compare to calc methof of EPBD, find overestimation of energy savings of 6{\%}


* A common approach to assess this behavioural change is by using econometric analyses on aggregated energy consumption data.


* Indoor temperature averages are misleading, as are setpoints - internal temperature demand and actual temperature are lower at night and when home is empty


* Hirst et al used only electricity billing and daily outdoor temp




Run simulations on big selection of simulated dwellings
- find under 10°C indoor temp independant of outdoor, about 15°C solar gains overrul chosen heating pattern.


Well insulated dwelling show indoor temp 1.5°C higher in winter.


On averate 0.94°C rise in internal temp
={\textgreater} Consistent with observed increases
={\textgreater} due only to physical process


Incorporate into standard building models by allowing variable annual mean internal temp, and by having mean internal temp as a function of insulation level},

The CFSR was designed and executed as a global, high-resolution coupled atmosphere–ocean–land surface–sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this period. The current CFSR will be extended as an operational, real-time product into the future. New features of the CFSR include 1) coupling of the atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6-h guess field, 2) an interactive sea ice model, and 3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) scheme over the entire period. The CFSR global atmosphere resolution is {\~{}}38 km (T382) with 64 levels extending from the surface to 0.26 hPa. The global ocean's latitudinal spacing is 0.25° at the equator, extending to a global 0.5° beyond the tropics, with 40 levels to a depth of 4737 m.

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to investigate the potential of diminishing the energy consumed by typical low thermal mass office buildings for heating, cooling and lighting by using smart windows. The windows considered consisted of a double pane glazing unit in which a controllable absorbing layer is added on the interior surface of the exterior glass pane. This absorbing layer allows to change the optical properties of the window, resulting in a direct potential of control of the incident solar heat flux entering the building through the windows. A corresponding numerical model is developed showing that optimizing the solar heat flux absorption rate of the absorbing layer in regard of the necessary heating, cooling and lighting needs helps reducing significantly the total yearly energy consumption, and cooling peak loads. The simulations were done considering a building located in Quebec City, Canada. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

direct effect generally seen about 30{\%}. But hard to estimate indirect effects


Debate on macro-economic side - hard to collect data.


Some studies indicate indirect energy requirements from consumption outweigh direct consumption.


Income effects - saving money on energy means it's spent on consumption ={\textgreater} greater energy use.


BUT technical improvements mean much consumption becomes cheaper anyway - could easily outweigh energy saving concerns (e.g. smartphones are everywhere, have large imbedded energy and carbon footpring)


={\textgreater} in any case, avoid mixing up energy rebound with resource rebound/use


econ neo-classical growth models: better energy efficiency gets better productivity and drives growth, so no actual savings
={\textgreater} but actually doesn't "replicate impacts of energy efficiency improvements" (Does this mean that we DO observe savings and this isn't show in model?)
={\textgreater} other models less conclusive that savings drive demand.


Howarth 1997 takes into account that energy is not raw input of production, finds efficiency always does produce savings


Econometric findings (finally some actual data!)


technical progress
* tricky modelling and interpretation
* tech change down with energy price up OR tech change increases share of energy in value of output (Jorgenson - also challenged)




CGE model for Netherlands using real energy efficiency tech data and standard IO tables. Long run 15{\%} rebound.


CGE model for Sweden with 60{\%} rebound.


Model with sensitivity analysis 35{\%} to 70{\%} rebound.


UK model showing 50{\%} short term, 30{\%} long term rebound - different in showing long term being lower than short term.


Country models make assumptions about government spending, tax levels etc which make them non transferrable. Mostly used for policy evaluation.

abstract = {Much of plasma behaviour is governed by multiple distinct nonlinear processes, operating on a wide range of lengthscales and timescales, that are coupled together in innumerable feedback loops. Capturing and quantifying this nonlinear behaviour is crucial at all levels of description, ranging from individual events to global phenomenology. In recent years, a range of techniques derived from complex systems science has been applied successfully to nonlinear plasma datasets. The present paper reviews several of these techniques in the context of applications spanning fusion, space, solar and astrophysical plasmas. Topics include non-Gaussian probability density functions, notably extreme event distributions in fusion and astrophysics and power law distributions in the solar context; differencing and rescaling of fluctuation data, which has yielded information on the number of dominant plasma turbulent processes, and the spatiotemporal ranges over which they operate, in plasmas ranging from microquasar accretion discs to L-mode and dithering H-mode fusion plasmas in the MAST tokamak; quantitative measures of mutual information content and pattern repetition between causally linked but spatiotemporally separated nonlinear events in solar wind and magnetospheric plasmas; global statistics of full-disc solar irradiance; and ELMing, considered as a sequence of pulsed events, in H-mode fusion plasmas in the JET tokamak. These developments in nonlinear plasma data characterization provide fresh additional insights into the underlying plasma physics. They also provide new opportunities for comparing models with data, and with each other, and open avenues for the development of a more rigorous predictive capability in this field.},

{\#} Motivation


Need to develop more reliable predictions of savings
Provide DECC with analysis for development of NEED framework


Main research objectives:
• To provide theoretical support for the data models and classifications being developed for both HEED and NEED, and protocols for the generation and standardisation of data;
• To ensure that these models and classifications are consistent with the needs of a range of users;
• To make exploratory analyses of data in HEED and data produced by the NEED pilot;
• To evaluate the opportunities that the full data frameworks will offer for further research
beyond the end of the project.




{\#} Method


Analysis of HEED data linked with meter data
HEED is in-action data - collected from many activities
Preliminary analysis of 11million homes
combination of many sources
energy data 2004 to 2007


Annualized elec meter data estimated calculated from Annual Advance or Estimated Annual Consumption
Annual Advance applies the sum of daily profile coefficients
={\textgreater} there is a model for daily consumption that exists and is in general use that applies a bunch of coeficients, factors, uses daily temp and standard profiles to calculate the estimated consumption for any building for any day of the year. There are a LOT of assumptions in here, but on the other hand is based on lots of average values which means that it should be actually pretty good approximation to the average case, even if it doesn capture much of the spread or variety. It could also misrepresent the average case if the distribution is very skewed/has a very long tail


DECC remove all consumptions over 50000kWh/yr as being non-domestic - bit of a botch fix for long tail, i should know.


Annualized Quantity (AQ) for gas also seasonal normal demand plus weather sensitive adjustment






{\#} Observations
Disparate data set make anaylsis difficult
Data collected for many different reasons. Hard to harmonise to research ready form. Quality varies a lot, issues only appear afterwards and there is no opportunity to re-survey dwellings and correct problems. possible biases but hard to pin down.


Linked energy data, especially Gas, subject to annual and weather correction. Process is opaque (and reasoning dubious IMHO)


Data set must be biased since buildings often show up BECAUSE they have an intervention - 80{\%} in HEED have had interventions, covers 50{\%} of housing stock, could expect much lower levels of interventions in remaining 50{\%} since they don't appear in HEED




Do find improvement of e.g. 8{\%} between dwellings with cavity wall insulated vs cavity wall uninsulated


Need to be careful because recording that a measure was taken like cavity wall doesn't say much about general state of property before and after, similarly no known insulation may not be 100{\%} reliable. (can imagine things like some cases cavity wall part of large refurb, other not. though could hope that with enough points everything evens out)


={\textgreater} impossible to reverse weather correction for gas data done by XoServe},

annote = {Analyse sensitivity of BREDEM using EHS data to generate distributions and feed them into monte carlo simulation




Bottom up stock models use something like BREDEM to model sample dwellings, then weight+avg to get model of whole building stock.


Sensitivity analysis is important for forming data collection - if you find you really need only some variables can collect data more cheaply.




“given that we are to use a BREDEM-?‐based model to evaluate a randomly selected gas powered, centrally heated house from the English dwelling stock, which of the model inputs are most important in determining the model output?”


Local vs Global sensitivity
={\textgreater} test variation around expected acceptable base point, useful
={\textgreater} BUT only works if model is linear and additive, BREDEM stock is not (cheng{\&}steemers)
={\textgreater} As more dimensions are added, One at a Time variation of inputs can only explore tiny {\%} of solution space
={\textgreater} need to be very sure initial values are good!




Method
------
Monte Carlo analysis to calc variance based global sensitivity indicies for SAP model inputs.


Use building energy model (see detailed description, handy recap of SAP)


As output, test both total emissions and emissions normalized by floor area


Generate MC inputs by pulling from EHS data (with alterations, not all SAP inputs incl. in EHS)


Important to consider some inputs very correlated, e.g. floor area and wall area.
Picking randomly ignoring correlation ={\textgreater} will get more "mid" houses (small wall/big floor and vice versa) and unerrepresent more extreme ones (small floor/small wall, big floor/big wall) ={\textgreater} underestimate variation
={\textgreater} Solve using Spearman Rank-order correlation


Similar for window type related variables (u value, glazing g, draft exclusion)





3.3 define variance based sensitivity indicies





Results
------
First, check that distribution of MC run matches SAP from input data -{\textgreater} good match when using correlated inputs, see fig 3


Most significant vars are geometry, heating system efficiency, external wall U-value
- accounts for 85{\%} of variation
- still 15{\%} variation, that's a lot!


Then include roof U, heating control type, galzing type
- cover 90{\%} of dwellings in -4.2{\%} to +7.2{\%}
- with 7 out of 19 vars


Model additive for small changes, not for larger ones.


Might think wall U and roof U would be equally important
- but most roof U small, while wall U evenly distributed about mean
- impact more from population properties than physical properties={\textgreater} when we look at correlations


Discussion
---------
Need to minimize uncertainty in geometry, heating system efficiency, wall U value to get better SAP calc},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to quantify the extent to which variation in heating season indoor temperatures is explained by dwelling and household characteristics and increased by energy efficiency improvements in low income households. A survey of dwellings in the Warm Front home energy efficiency scheme was carried out in five urban areas of England. Half-hourly living room and main bedroom temperatures were recorded for 2–4 weeks over two winters. For each dwelling, regression of indoor on outdoor temperature was used to obtain estimates of daytime living room and night time bedroom temperatures under standardized conditions (outdoor temperature of 5°C). The results indicate that the median standardized daytime living room temperature was 19.1°C and the median standardized night time bedroom temperature 17.1°C. Temperatures were influenced by property characteristics, including its age, construction and thermal efficiency and also by the household number of people and the age of the head of household. Dwellings that received both heating and insulation measures through the Warm Front scheme had daytime living room temperatures 1.6°C higher than pre-intervention dwellings, night time bedroom temperatures were 2.8°C higher. Warm Front energy efficiency improvements lead to substantial improvements of both living room and bedroom temperatures which are likely to have benefits in terms of thermal comfort and well-being.},

abstract = {The identification of building rooftops from a single image, without the use of auxiliary 3-D information like stereo pairs or digital elevation models, is a very challenging and difficult task in the area of remote sensing. The existing methodologies rarely tackle the problem of 3-D object identification, like buildings, from a purely stochastic viewpoint. Our approach is based on a stochastic image interpretation model, which combines both 2-D and 3-D contextual information of the imaged scene. Building rooftop hypotheses are extracted using a contour-based grouping hierarchy that emanates from the principles of perceptual organization. We use a Markov random field model to describe the dependencies between all available hypotheses with regard to a globally consistent interpretation. The hypothesis verification step is treated as a stochastic optimization process that operates on the whole grouping hierarchy to find the globally optimal configuration for the locally interacting grouping hypotheses, providing also an estimate of the height of each extracted rooftop. This paper describes the main principles of our method and presents building detection results on a set of synthetic and airborne images.},

In particular, it looks at energy consumption in everyday home environments to examine the relationship between behavioral patterns and energy consumption. It first demonstrates how data mining techniques may be used to find patterns and anomalies in smart home-based energy data. Next, it describes a method to correlate home-based activities with electricity usage. Finally, it describes how this information could inform users about their personal energy consumption and to support activities in a more energy-efficient manner. These approaches are validated by using real energy data collected in a set of smart home testbeds.},

@article{Kane2011a,
abstract = {The 2008 Climate Change Act has committed the UK government to reduce CO2 emissions by 80{\%} of 1990 levels by 2050. To meet this target a significant reduction in energy consumption will be required from domestic dwellings and in particular space heating which accounts for more than 50{\%} of the energy used in the UK housing stock. The UK government has initiated a number of policies to reduce energy use from UK dwellings. Energy savings that result from energy efficiency improvements to dwellings have sometime been lower than expected as a result for the rebound effect. Discussion of the rebound effect has questioned whether these polices will result in the CO2 reductions required to meet the national targets. Large-scale survey research has shown that energy use is related to climate, built form of properties, efficiency of heating systems, socio- economic indicators and occupant behaviour. Temperature monitoring studies have been undertaken to gain insight into how occupants heat their homes. If the variation in indoor temperatures can be explained by; (1) social determinants such as age, income and the number of household occupants and; (2) technical determinants such as house type, house age and level of insulation then this would enable energy efficiency initiatives (e.g. cavity wall installation or education programmes) to be targeted where they will be most effective. This paper presents preliminary results from a large-scale city-wide survey of over 500 homes in the city of Leicester, UK. temperature measurements were recorded at hourly intervals over a nine month period for the living room and main bedroom spaces in over 300 homes. Household data, including socio-demographic information, was collected for each household. This dataset is used to investigate indoor temperatures across house types. The results confirm that house type is related to differences in indoor temperatures. Flats have the highest average temperatures while detached homes have the lowest. To gain insight into heated periods households with average evening temperatures were identified. It was found 45{\%} of mid terrace properties had evening temperatures below 18°C and more than a third of detached and semi detached home also had cold evening temperatures. There are a number of reasons for low indoor temperatures in dwellings during occupied periods including inefficiency of buildings and heating systems, the inability of occupants to afford heating and personal choice. It is concluded that to meet Government CO2 reduction targets the rebound effect should be taken into account when calculating the energy savings expected from energy efficiency programmes. Further analysis is ongoing to identify how other social and technical factors relate to indoor temperatures. Multiple regression analysis will be used to identify how internal temperatures are correlated against a number of determinants including building characteristics (built form type, age, heating system type, heating controls) and household characteristics (age of occupants, income).},

The methodology described in this report can be used to calculate the EnergyPlus infiltration input for any given building level infiltration rate specified at known pressure difference. The sensitivity analysis shows that EnergyPlus calculates the wind speed based on zone altitude, and the linear wind velocity coefficient represents the variation in infiltration heat loss consistent with building location and weather data. EnergyPlus infiltration input is calculated to be 0.2016 cfm/sf of exterior wall area, assuming that uncontrolled air leakage through the building envelope can be specified by a baseline leakage rate of 1.8 cfm/sf (@ 0.30 in. w.c) of exterior above grade envelope area (based on ASHRAE SSPC-90.1 Envelope Subcommittee recommendation).},

Benchmarking models are mostly constructed in a simple benchmark table (percentile table) of energy use, which is normalized with floor area and temperature. This paper describes a benchmarking process for energy efficiency by means of multiple regression analysis, where the relationship between energy-use intensities (EUIs) and the explanatory factors (e.g., operating hours) is developed. Using the resulting regression model, these EUIs are then normalized by removing the effect of deviance in the significant explanatory factors. The empirical cumulative distribution of the normalized EUI gives a benchmark table (or percentile table of EUI) for benchmarking an observed EUI. The advantage of this approach is that the benchmark table represents a normalized distribution of EUI, taking into account all the significant explanatory factors that affect energy consumption. An application to supermarkets is presented to illustrate the development and the use of the benchmarking method.},

abstract = {European and national policies are aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and increasing energy efficiency - also in the household sector. For this purpose, new solutions for private homes based on information and communication technologies (ICT) are being developed and tested. However, up to now, hardly anyone has seen, experienced or lived in an environment that offers the full range of ICT-based energy management solutions. In this study, consumer reactions to a fully furnished and equipped smart home are analysed using focus groups (four groups with a total of 29 participants). The analysis looks at consumer perceptions of and reactions to an energy management system which optimizes electricity consumption based on different ICT solutions. The topics that were demonstrated in practice and then discussed with the participants included variable tariffs, smart metering, smart appliances, and home automation. In general, there were positive group reactions to the smart home environment. Consumers saw many advantages for themselves; especially the chance to save money. However, giving up high levels of flexibility and adapting everyday routines to fit in with electricity tariffs were regarded as difficult. Smart appliances and smart meters were therefore considered to be necessary elements by most participants. Concerns regarding data privacy played a major role in one of the groups.

Two different operating regimes have been considered: (1) thermostatically controlled temperature, typical of buildings with auxiliary heating systems; and (2) free-floating temperature, typical of buildings without auxiliary heating systems. In the latter case, to quantify the thermal behaviour of the building, a comfort solar fraction is introduced. In this method, the solar fraction is a function of three parameters: (1) the solar/load ratio; (2) the building thermal inertia; and (3) the monthly non-utilizability. Some examples of the application of the new method are presented, as well as comparisons with the results from existing methods.},

The project had four key goals: to measure volumetric consumption of DHW and the associated energy requirement; to identify DHW heating patterns in terms of both times and temperatures; to compare these results with the current BREDEM assumptions and finally to identify where in the dwelling water is being consumed. These goals have informed both the data collection and the analysis subsequently carried out on that data. Hot water consumption, delivery temperature and incoming cold feed temperature were measured in all dwellings. In those with a system boiler an additional measurement was made of the primary pipework temperature, to enable the times of day at which water was heated to be identified. In a limited number of properties additional temperature measurements were made at each hot water outlet, allowing the destination of each run-off to be determined. Normally, data was accumulated at ten minute intervals. When a run-off was detected this was changed to five seconds for the duration of the run-off. This allowed accurate determination of the energy associated with the run-off and, where the additional information was available, the destination of that run-off.},

@article{Eberard2007,
abstract = {It is shown that the intrinsic geometry associated with equilibrium thermodynamics, namely the contact geometry, provides also a suitable framework in order to deal with irreversible thermodynamical processes. Therefore we introduce a class of dynamical systems on contact manifolds, called conservative contact systems, defined as contact vector fields generated by some contact Hamiltonian function satisfying a compatibility condition with some Legendre submanifold of the contact manifold. Considering physical systems' modeling, the Legendre submanifold corresponds to the definition of the thermodynamical properties of the system and the contact Hamiltonian function corresponds to the definition of some irreversible processes taking place in the system. Open thermodynamical systems may also be modeled by augmenting the conservative contact systems with some input and output variables (in the sense of automatic control) and so-called input vector fields and lead to the definition of port contact systems. Finally complex systems consisting of coupled simple thermodynamical or mechanical systems may be represented by the composition of such port contact systems through algebraic relations called interconnection structure. Two examples illustrate this composition of contact systems: a gas under a piston submitted to some external force and the conduction of heat between two media with external thermostat. ?? 2007 Polish Scientific Publishers PWN, Warszawa.},

@article{Biddulph2014,
abstract = {Evaluating how much heat is lost through external walls is a key requirement for building energy simulators and is necessary for quality assurance and successful decision making in policy making and building design, construction and refurbishment. Heat loss can be estimated using the temperature differences between the inside and outside air and an estimate of the thermal transmittance (U-value) of the wall. Unfortunately the actual U-value may be different from those values obtained using assumptions about the materials, their properties and the structure of the wall after a cursory visual inspection. In-situ monitoring using thermometers and heat flux plates enables more accurate characterisation of the thermal properties of walls in their context. However, standard practices require that the measurements are carried out in winter over a two-week period to significantly reduce the dynamic effects of the wall's thermal mass from the data. A novel combination of a lumped thermal mass model, together with Bayesian statistical analysis is presented to derive estimates of the U-value and effective thermal mass. The method needs only a few days of measurements, provides an estimate of the effective thermal mass and could potentially be used in summer.},

It requires not only large investments in the communication and metering infrastructure, but also a redesign of traditional business processes. The newly incurring costs cannot be fully passed on to the end customers. One option to counterbalance these expenses is to exploit the newly generated smart metering data for the creation of new services and improved processes. For instance, performing a cluster analysis of smart metering data focused on the customers' time-based consumption behavior allows for a detailed customer segmentation. In the article we present a cluster analysis performed on real-world consumption data from a smart meter project conducted by a German regional utilities company. We show how to integrate a cluster analysis approach into a business intelligence environment and evaluate this artifact as defined by design science. We discuss the results of the cluster analysis and highlight options to apply them to segment-specific tariff design.},

Therefore, the Direct Insolation Simulation Code (DISC) employs an exponential relationship betweenKn and air mass which is parametric in Kt. This algorithm seems to provide a satisfactory Kn-Kt relationship for a wide range of stations and seasons. Validation of the DISC Model was accomplished with data from three widely separated stations (Albuquerque, Bismarck, and Brownsville) which were not used for model development. Comparisons with the ETMY model (used to generate direct normal data for 222 of the 248 stations in the national data base) showed substantial improvements in the accuracy of hourly values, significant reductions in monthly RMS errors, and equivalent monthly mean bias errors. Furthermore, modification of the DISC model to incorporate cloud-cover, water vapor, and albedo terms appears to be straightforward.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development, evaluation and application of the Domestic Energy and Carbon Model (DECM) for predicting the energy consumptions and carbon dioxide emissions of the existing English housing stock. A novel feature of DECM is the adoption of an occupancy pattern model which is derived from the household employment status data. We believe this modification has significantly improved the accuracy of the estimation in space heating energy use. At national level, the model estimation of carbon emissions and gas and electricity consumptions are respectively 4.5{\%}, 3.4{\%} and 1.0{\%} higher than the national statistics. At the sub-national level (Local Authority), two methods are used to produce estimations: one based on dwelling type and the other based on socio-economic class. For both methods, the correlations between the model estimations and the government records are statistically significant and substantial (all rs {\textgreater} 0.9 and ps{\textless}0.01). According to the results, it can be inferred that over 85{\%} of the variance in dwelling energy consumptions and carbon emissions can be accounted for by dwelling type and the socio-economic class of households. The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis which examines the effects of various building fabric and service system parameters on the modelled average carbon emissions per dwelling. Based on the findings, a set of predictive charts are developed which can provide rapid estimations of the effect of various energy efficiency measures on dwelling energy consumptions and carbon emissions taking into account the potential rebound effect.

abstract = {Many real-world complex systems are adequately represented by networks of interacting or
 interdependent networks. Additionally, it is often reasonable to take into account node weights such
 as surface area in climate networks, volume in brain networks, or economic capacity in trade
 networks to reflect the varying size or importance of subsystems. Combining both ideas, we derive a
 novel class of statistical measures for analysing the structure of networks of interacting networks
 with heterogeneous node weights. Using a prototypical spatial network model, we show that the newly
 introduced node-weighted interacting network measures provide an improved representation of the
 underlying system's properties as compared to their unweighted analogues. We apply our method to
 study the complex network structure of cross-boundary trade between European Union (EU) and non-EU
 countries finding that it provides relevant information on trade balance and economic robustness.},

abstract = {The existing buildings stock in European countries accounts for over 40{\%} of final energy consumption in the European Union (EU) member states, of which residential use represents 63{\%} of total energy consumption in the buildings sector. Consequently, an increase of building energy performance can constitute an important instrument in the efforts to alleviate the EU energy import dependency and comply with the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This is also in accordance to the European Directive on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD), which has come to effect on 4 January 2006. The energy performance assessment for existing dwellings (EPA-ED) is a new methodology supported by software, developed in the framework of a European project that focuses on energy related issues for existing residential buildings, in line with the EPBD. This paper presents an overview of the method and software that can be used to perform building energy audits and assess buildings in a uniform way, perform demand and savings calculations, provide owners with specific advice for measures to improve energy performance, issue an energy performance certificate for existing buildings, and include some representative results from the pilot studies performed in several European countries. Also the sister-method EPA-NR, on non-residential buildings, currently under construction, is introduced.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work was to determine site specific coefficients (within the U.S.) for use with the Perez diffuse irradiance model. The model pre- dicts diffuse irradiance on tilted planes of any orientation for all insola- tion conditions, based on the knowledge of direct and global (or diffuse) irradiance. This is a component of SNLA's photovoltaic simulation program PVFORM. The model consists of ( 1 ) a pre-set geometric framework that describes the main nonFisotropic features of sky radiance circumsolar and horizonlzenith effects - and ( 2 ) an experimentally derived component that describes the variations of these anisotropic effects with weather condi- tions. A measurement program was initiated to provide the data necessary for ( 1 deriving the model's experimental component for several US locations, ( 2 ) comparing model configuration and evaluating performance at these locations and ( 3 ) evaluating site dependency and recommending, if justified, model con.- figurations adapted to particular environments/climates. Five environmentally distinct sites were selected based on their potential impact on model perfor- mance. In addition, work was performed to improve sky condition parameteriza- tion and eliminate all unjustified complexities of the original model. The main results of this work are the following: ( 1 ) the model algorithm has been greatly simplified while conserving original accuracy, ( 2 ) the physical soundness and effectiveness of the insolation parameterization method have been improved, ( 3 ) one unique model, with a fixed set of coefficients, has been shown to be sufficiently accurate to describe sites within the U.S.},

annote = {Energy Saving trust


Reduced energy savings from increase in "comfort level"
={\textgreater} note that a pattern emerges, assumption that increase "comfort" is equivalent to increase temperature, that increase temperature is equivalent to heating system working more.


Compare to BREDEM model


Lots of problems with collecting data - insulation not installed, appointments not made, records lost... from 88 initial 59 usable


18.1±1.5{\%} saving on average
0.57°C increase in average internal temperature


Thanks to sensor, COULD measure heating patterns.
Avg 8.8hrs/day (vs BREDEM 9hrs)
9.1hrs weekends, 8.7 weekdays


Actual Savings of 447 kWh/day


BREDEM predicted 34{\%} (749kWh/day) saving (reduction of 40{\%} compared)


BREDEM calc wtih measured temp (vs assumed temp) predict 629kWh/day (reduction 29{\%})


Comparing BREDEM using theoretical and actual internal temp (which is higher, i guess) calculate 16{\%} loss of saving due to higher temperature.




Small increase in temperature can have large increase in energy consumption because insulation is generally not over the whole house.


Gathering data
Data is always a mess when collecting from houses - can't make any good assumptions, hard to compare accross differently built and used houses.
={\textgreater} interest in consumption-only studies, especially with smartmeters, data is much simpler and better behaved. But to build stat models still need detailed data for subset and hope we can scale out.


Importance of specific temperature data for each monitored house.


Plot energy consumption against internal-external temperature difference, straight line fit with slope giving building specific heat loss.
={\textgreater} advantage that you can check for wierd values




Find a reduction in consumption in W/K, but take into account uncertainty find that it's not statistically significant - uncertainlty larger than the reduction.


Can also "force" a fixed point by assuming that energy input for heating should be zero for zero temperature difference. But this is not necessarily justified because there are also gains (e.g. from sun and people) and losses (e.g. hot water going down the drain) - Some cases can reasonably set to zero.
={\textgreater} this seriously increases confidence level
={\textgreater} generally no reason why intercept should change with insulation if it relates to gain from ppl/solar and hot water loss, so can set to zero or set to equal pre/post.


Temperature Takeback
Definite trend of temp after installation being higher than before, with increase of 0.57°C
(remeber this might not be behavioural)
Find that avg takeback higher for priority grp but not statistically significant to 5{\%} (but yes to 10{\%}). No correlation between initial temp and temp gain (which you might expect if before refurb people were limited by cost or not working heating)




Heating Patterns
Tricky to identify on-times even with monitor on heater.
heating patterns about 9hrs a day consistent with BREDEM assumptions.


BREDEM predictions
Problems with conservatories - depending on how you use them (only open connecting door when heating to be gained vs always opened and treated as part of space) can be net gain or double total house consumption! So kick out conservatories.


BREDEM gives a good estimation after insulation but big overestimation of total consumption before, and therefore overestimation of actual savings.


Overall a good correlation in the "direction" of predicted and actual savings but always offset from actual values.


When using Measured temperatures get a better estimation of total consumption (+5{\%} before, -6{\%} after)
={\textgreater} suggests internal temperature is main source of error
={\textgreater} consistent with shipworth sensitivity analysis
={\textgreater} Still measure a large missing amount of savings},

abstract = {The Lancet Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change is an international, multidisciplinary research collaboration between academic institutions and practitioners across the world. It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission, which concluded that the response to climate change could be " the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century " . The Lancet Countdown aims to track the health impacts of climate hazards; health resilience and adaptation; health co-benefi ts of climate change mitigation; economics and fi nance; and political and broader engagement. These focus areas form the fi ve thematic working groups of the Lancet Countdown and represent diff erent aspects of the complex association between health and climate change. These thematic groups will provide indicators for a global overview of health and climate change; national case studies highlighting countries leading the way or going against the trend; and engagement with a range of stakeholders. The Lancet Countdown ultimately aims to report annually on a series of indicators across these fi ve working groups. This paper outlines the potential indicators and indicator domains to be tracked by the collaboration, with suggestions on the methodologies and datasets available to achieve this end. The proposed indicator domains require further refi nement, and mark the beginning of an ongoing consultation process—from November, 2016 to early 2017—to develop these domains, identify key areas not currently covered, and change indicators where necessary. This collaboration will actively seek to engage with existing monitoring processes, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and WHO's climate and health country profi les. The indicators will also evolve over time through ongoing collaboration with experts and a range of stakeholders, and be dependent on the emergence of new evidence and knowledge. During the course of its work, the Lancet Countdown will adopt a collaborative and iterative process, which aims to complement existing initiatives, welcome engagement with new partners, and be open to developing new research projects on health and climate change.},

Object detection has benefited enormously from large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning. For semantic urban scene understanding, however, no current dataset adequately captures the complexity of real-world urban scenes. To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations; 20000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark.},

Currently, urban planners are hindered by a lack of information available in a format suitable for the large-scale analysis of sidewalk design. To demonstrate the impact that information technology could have in this area, we leverage techniques from machine learning and computer vision to gather information about the presence and quality of sidewalks in map images. In particular, we identify sidewalk segments in street view images using a random forest classifier, utilizing a set of local and global features that include geometric context, presence of lanes, pixel color, and location. Our results illustrate that this approach is effective in classifying sidewalk segments in a large set of street view images. This algorithm can be easily extended to other datasets, and can be automated to gather complete, fine-grained details about sidewalks for arbitrarily large urban environments.},

The results show, on average, fairly close agreement between the observed consumption Ctot, obs and the consumption Ctot, the (predicted according to the French procedure), although with some tendency towards overconsumption (or underprediction), Ctot, obs being 6{\%} higher than Ctot, the. Among individual consumers there is much scatter, especially for apartments. Characterized in terms of the r.m.s. variation of the ratio Ctot, obs/Ctot, the, the scatter is 0.3 for single-family residences and 0.5 for apartments. The scatter appears to be mostly due to behavioural effects, as suggested by the large variation (almost 2 to 1) between highest and lowest consumption in a group of six identical row houses. A detailed comparison between predicted and observed PRISM parameters (heating slope, base level and balance temperature) is presented for a subset of 82 single-family houses where the uncertainties are sufficiently small. Most of the overconsumption arises from differences between predicted and observed values of the base level (hot water and cooking), whereas for space heating prediction and observation agree within one percent. An attempt to correlate the ratio Ctot, obs/Ctot, the with data from the questionnaire has remained inconclusive for the most part. ?? 1991.},

If the simulation results do not match actual monitored data, the programmer will typically “adjust” inputs and operating parameters on a trial-and-error basis until the program output matches the known data. This “fudging” process often results in the manipulation of a large number of variables, which may significantly decrease the credibility of the entire simulation. A major drawback to the widespread acceptance and credibility of the calibrated simulation approach is that it is highly dependent on the personal judgment of the analyst doing the calibration. The lack of a proper mathematical foundation for the general calibration problem has greatly contributed to the current state of affairs.

This report provides an overview of a number of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) clear sky models from very simple to complex. Validation of clear-sky models requires comparison of model results to measured irradiance during clear-sky periods. To facilitate validation, we present a new algorithm for automatically identifying clear-sky periods in a time series of GHI measurements. We evaluate the performance of selected clear-sky models using measured data from 30 different sites, totaling about 300 site-years of data. We analyze the variation of these errors across time and location. In terms of error averaged over all locations and times, we found that complex models that correctly account for all the atmospheric parameters are slightly more accurate than other models, but, primarily at low elevations, comparable accuracy can be obtained from some simpler models. However, simpler models often exhibit errors that vary with time of day and season, whereas the errors for complex models vary less over time.},

Because sample coefficient alpha is consistently biased downward, it is more likely to yield a misleading impression of poor reliability. The magnitude of the bias is greatest precisely when the variability of sample alpha is greatest (small population reliability and small sample size). Taking into account the variability of sample alpha with an interval estimator may lead to retaining reliable tests that would be otherwise rejected. Here, the authors performed simulation studies to investigate the behavior of asymptotically distribution-free (ADF) versus normal-theory interval estimators of coefficient alpha under varied conditions. Normal-theory intervals were found to be less accurate when item skewness {\textgreater}1 or excess kurtosis {\textgreater}1. For sample sizes over 100 observations, ADF intervals are preferable, regardless of item skewness and kurtosis. A formula for computing ADF confidence intervals for coefficient alpha for tests of any size is provided, along with its implementation as an SAS macro.},

Studies have shown that occupant behaviour might play a prominent role in the variation in energy consumption in different households but the extent of such influence is unknown. The impact of the building's thermal characteristics on space heating demand has been well studied. There is however, little work done that incorporates the impact of consumer behaviour. This study aims to gain greater insight into the effect of occupant behaviour on energy consumption for space heating by determining its effect on the variation of energy consumption in dwellings while controlling for building characteristics. The KWR database from the Ministry of Housing in the Netherlands was used. This study showed that occupant characteristics and behaviour significantly affect energy use (4.2{\%}), but building characteristics still determine a large part of the energy use in a dwelling (42{\%}). Further analysis showed that some occupant behaviour is determined by the type of dwelling or HVAC systems and, therefore, the effect of occupant characteristics might be larger than expected, since these determine the type of dwelling.},

abstract = {All dwellings need a supply of fresh air, not just for the health and comfort of the occupants, but also to control condensation, remove pollutants, and to ensure the safe and efficient operation of some combustion appliances. The amount of fresh air should match the needs of the dwelling and the people living within it. To achieve an energy efficient standard of ventilation requires consideration of both the building fabric and the efficiency of the ventilation system. Whether designs for new or existing buildings are under consideration, ventilation should be thought of as part of an integrated design approach for achieving energy efficiency. Thermal insulation, heating systems and controls, and householder advice are some other important aspects to consider during the design process.Home energy use is responsible for 27 per cent of UK carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. (CO2 is one of the main gases that contribute to climate change.) By following the Energy Saving Trust's best practice standards, new build and refurbished housing will be more energy efficient – reducing these emissions, and saving energy and money, as well as safeguarding the environment. Traditionally, many UK dwellings have relied on natural air infiltration to provide ventilation. This can result in excessive ventilation rates that increase energy consumption for space heating, and cause discomfort to occupants because of cold draughts. Energy loss due to ventilation accounts for approximately a fifth of space-heating energy demand in an older poorly insulated dwelling. In a new energy efficient house the high insulation levels mean that the proportion of space-heating demand due to ventilation increases to around a third. Equally, natural air infiltration alone can result, at times, in too little ventilation. This leads to poor indoor air quality and other, more readily visible impacts such as condensation and mould on indoor surfaces. The objective of a good ventilation strategy is, therefore, to provide a balance between energy efficiency and indoor air quality.},

Researches on this topic have been mostly conducted for office buildings, but were limited for exterior shading devices of high-rise buildings, where cooling is a major energy consumer. This paper presents an integrated approach for exterior shading design analysis about energy performance and economic feasibility in a high-rise residential building (Seoul, Korea) by both numerical simulations and field mock-up test for possibility of installing. The sun-shading/daylighting performance analysis of the 48 exterior shading devices was measured with 4.0 m ?? 3.2 m window module size during the period of May-September. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the cooling energy saving potential of solar radiation controls was conducted with DOE-2.1E simulation program. The cooling energy saving potential was about 20{\%}, while the reducing of solar heat gain by the two exterior shading devices (the horizontal overhang and the vertical panel) would lead to a decrease of the cooling energy demand 19.7{\%} and 17.3{\%}, respectively. Cost benefit and economic feasibility was also analyzed, in consideration of the OPEX and CAPEX, depending on the shading type. The significance of this study lies in providing basic information for rational exterior shading planning, when designing high-rise residential buildings. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Additionally, the influence of energy subsidies, such as the UK's Renewable Heat Incentives and Feed in Tariffs, is analysed to determine if they have the desired effect of increasing the economic competitiveness of renewable energy systems.},

abstract = {To provide information on climate change, the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) provided the latest UKCP09 data to a resolution of 5 km square grids for the UK. Those data sets were used in this study along with the historical measured data for two locations-Bracknell (London) and Edinburgh-to critically analyse the likely changes that may occur in the sol-air temperature and daylight illuminance profiles. These parameters have an important bearing on the design and function of buildings and building services.Drastic increment of sol-air temperature was found for the projected data sets. An increase of as much as 20.1 ??C of sol-air temperature for dark-coloured surface was found for Edinburgh and 13.3 ??C for Bracknell. These increments may be due to the compound effect of change in the constituent variables that are used to calculate sol-air temperature, i.e. solar radiation, wind speed and dry bulb temperature. A sensitivity test was carried out to see the effect of each variable on sol-air temperature.An increasing trend of daylight was also found in the data sets. This is attributed to the changing clarity of the sky condition. The predictions indicate a radical change in the characteristics of solar climate, i.e. from the present diffuse fraction of total irradiation of 0.37 which indicates mild turbidity to a drop of 0.13 indicating clear skies with exceptionally low turbidity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {When the UK electricity industry was privatised over a decade ago, obligations were placed upon suppliers to improve energy efficiency. The resulting Energy Efficiency Standards of Performance (EESoP) have been in force since 1994, overseen by the industry regulatory body and funded through a special revenue allowance. This paper describes the results of monitoring to observe savings actually achieved as a result of the provision of insulation measures in electrically heated properties under the first two programmes, EESoP 1 and EESoP 2, covering the period up to March 2000. Two different approaches were used. In EESoP1, an analysis of a sample of meter readings from 5{\%} of dwellings before and after installation of measures was undertaken. In EESoP2, temperature and consumption monitoring of a smaller sample of dwellings was undertaken, including customer questionnaires to identify any external factors that may have influenced electricity consumption. Analysis of meter readings from almost 8 000 dwellings in EESoP1 revealed a 12{\%} saving in electricity consumption, corresponding to a reduction of 163 kg C per property in yearly CO2 emissions. Although large enough to be considered cost-effective, the savings were lower than expected. This has previously been attributed to a ‘comfort factor', which assumed that savings were realised as higher indoor temperatures. The analysis described in this paper finds that the main reason for lower savings is that the homes monitored appear to be heated to a lower standard than assumed in the calculation of the savings, although a small rise in average indoor temperatures was observed after insulation.},

abstract = {The primary aim of this study was to analyse the significance of household temperature in determining the amount of potential energy savings taken back in the form of an increase in the comfort temperature following energy efficiency improvements. If the dual goals of energy conservation and affordable warmth for low-income households are to be attained, the nature of takeback must be more thoroughly understood so that the full benefit of energy efficiency measures can be assessed along with the carbon/energy savings. However, very little analysis has been carried out to quantify the benefit taken as warmth. This research examines the results of a number of monitored energy efficiency projects undertaken in Britain over the past 20 years to try to determine the most important influences on temperature takeback. The main findings are:•the internal temperature is the main determinant on the amount of benefit from energy efficiency measures that will be taken as an increase in comfort rather than as an energy saving;•at 16.5°C, the current average temperature of housing in Great Britain, about 30{\%} of the benefit of an energy efficiency improvement would be taken as a temperature increase and the rest as an energy saving;•at temperatures as low as 14°C — still frequently found in low-income households — only half of the energy saving will be achieved and the remainder would be taken as a temperature increase;•20°C is the most likely whole house comfort temperature in an energy efficient house and it is only in these circumstances that further improvements will achieve the full energy saving;•there has been a narrowing of the gap in average indoor winter temperatures of the different tenure types and tenure alone is no longer a definitive indicator of household temperature;•living room temperature is not a good indicator in the UK of whole house average temperature, as a warm living room may be found in an otherwise cold house, particularly in low-income households without central heating;•as there is now little difference between the average temperatures of local authority and owner occupied households, there should be little difference in the overall degree of takeback between these two tenures;•energy efficiency measures which increase radiant temperature, such as double glazing, enable the occupants to be comfortable at a lower air temperature and thus reduce the degree of takeback by up to 20{\%};•there is a lack of suitably monitored and analysed projects to enable a rigorous assessment of takeback, particularly for higher income households;•the present low levels of warmth and slow rate of improvement in average temperatures will mean that investment in the energy efficiency of the UK housing stock will fail to achieve the predicted energy savings for at least another 15 years.},

abstract = {The short-term dependency of energy demand for space heating on winter temperature in the Swiss commercial sector is well understood. This provides a basis for estimating the effect on demand of longer term changes in temperature, such as those reported for the period 1970-2003 (Hofer, 2003) and the further warming of several degrees C expected in the coming decades (Hohmann/Neu, 2004). Energy demand for space cooling is at present small and variations in summer temperature are hardly detectable in the national electricity demand pattern. But due to higher internal loads, fashionable glass facades and increasing comfort levels, the cooled floor area is steadily increasing. Events like the summer of 2003 are accelerating this trend and the specific energy demand for cooling. It is important, therefore, to develop a better understanding of the relationship between summer weather conditions and energy demand for cooling. In this paper we explore possible changes in heating and cooling demand in the Swiss commercial sector over the next 30 years, taking account of the expected temperature increase and the evolution of the stock of buildings and their equipment. Two principal scenarios are evaluated: a reference case in which temperatures remain constant; and a second case in which temperatures increase. For heating demand, changes in specific energy consumption are evaluated; for cooling demand, specific energy demand and floor area equipped with cooling equipment are varied. Although the principal focus of the work is on Switzerland, it is possible to extend the analysis to other parts of Europe. Energy consumption data for the commercial sector is sparse, particularly for cooling, but simulations have been used effectively in this context. (Adnot et al., 1999 and 2003). For much of Europe, we conclude that likely increases in cooling energy demand due to global warming will be outweighed by reductions in the need for heating energy. There is likely to be a net increase in demand for electricity in all but the most Northerly countries, however, and in the South a significant increase in summer peak demand. Depending on the generation mix in particular countries, the net effect on carbon dioxide emissions may be an increase even where overall demand for delivered energy is reduced.},

This research proposes a probabilistic, engineering-based, bottom-up model to address these issues. In a recent study we classified London's non-domestic buildings based on the service they provide, such as offices, retail premise, and schools, and proposed the creation of one probabilistic representational model per building type. This paper investigates techniques for the development of such models. The representational model is a statistical surrogate of a dynamic energy simulation (ES) model. We first identify the main parameters affecting energy consumption in a particular building sector/type by using sampling-based global sensitivity analysis methods, and then generate statistical surrogate models of the dynamic ES model within the dominant model parameters. Given a sample of actual energy consumption for that sector, we use the surrogate model to infer the distribution of model parameters by inverse analysis. The inferred distributions of input parameters are able to quantify the relative benefits of alternative energy saving measures on an entire building sector with requisite quantification of uncertainties. Secondary school buildings are used for illustrating the application of this probabilistic method.},

abstract = {The present paper suggests a procedure for identification of suitable models for the heat dynamics of a building. Such a procedure for model identification is essential for better usage of readings from smart meters, which is expected to be installed in almost all buildings in the coming years. The models can be used for different purposes, e.g. control of the indoor climate, forecasting of energy consumption, and for accurate description of energy performance of the building. Grey-box models based on prior physical knowledge and data-driven modelling are applied. This facilitates insight into otherwise hidden information about the physical properties of the building. A hierarchy of models of increasing complexity is formulated based on prior physical knowledge and a forward selection strategy is suggested enabling the modeller to iteratively select suitable models of increasing complexity. The performance of the models is compared using likelihood ratio tests, and they are validated using a combination of appropriate statistics and physical interpretation of the results. A case study is described in which a suitable model is sought after for a single storey 120m2 building. The result is a set of different models of increasing complexity, with which building characteristics, such as: thermal conductivity, heat capacity of different parts, and window area, are estimated.},

abstract = {Improved methods for quantifying energy savings in buildings need to be supported by empirical measures rather than modeled estimates of future annual energy demand. This paper uses power temperature gradient (PTG, W/K), or the slope of power demand in response to changes in external air temperature; first, to categorise dwelling energy performance from daily energy data (when 0–15°C outside); second, to investigate variations in 24-h profiles of delivered power. Estimates of PTG were obtained from 567 UK dwellings with 118,000 days of gas and electricity data. From a multivariable regression model, PTG was predicted by dwelling characteristics (number of bedrooms, number of floors, dwelling type, and dwelling age category (all p{\textless}0.001)) but not by number of occupants. When dwellings were grouped into quintiles of PTG, mean PTG had threefold increase from the first to fifth quintile (188 to 563W/K, respectively). This was reflected in 24-h profiles of delivered power (30min intervals): at 0°C, each 100W/K decline in PTG corresponded to ∼2.5kW decline in mean morning and evening peak power. Using PTG to estimate reductions in peak power as equivalent ‘negawatts' reframes potential benefits of energy efficiency retrofits and for grid resilience.},

Such sources include measurement equipment (notably the domestic meter, NTS offtake meters and NTS offtake CV determination devices), assumptions behind the fixed factors used for volume conversion required by the Gas (Calculation of Thermal Energy) Regulations, and the variation in CV experienced by consumers in a particular charging area. Having made estimates of consumer billing accuracy, the impact of reducing the accuracy of CV determination for entry of small volumes of gas is estimated. The principal driver for reducing the accuracy of CV determination is to reduce obstacles to uptake of use of renewable gas supplies such as biomethane, but the approach is applicable to entry of small volumes of any gas.

abstract = {Current practices show that the goals of energy saving and CO2 reductions for creating an energy-neutral building stock can only be reached by strict and supportive governmental policies. In Europe the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) and the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) are driving forces for member states to develop and strengthen energy performance regulations both for new buildings (via building approval procedures) and the existing building stock (via energy performance certificates or labels). The effectiveness of these current governance instruments and their impact on actual CO2 reductions are found to be inadequate for ensuring actual (not hypothecated) energy performance is achieved. To realize the very ambitious energy-saving goals a radical rethink of regulatory systems and instruments is necessary. Building performance and the behaviour of the occupants is not well understood by policy-makers. Alternative forms of governance are needed that have more impact on the actual outcomes. Supportive governance to stimulate near-zero renovations in combination with performance guarantees is a promising approach. Furthermore, engagement with occupant practices and behaviours is needed. To ensure accurate outcomes-based governance, a better understanding of building performance and behaviours of occupants must be incorporated.},

abstract = {Domestic energy consumption (DEC) has been traditionally understood using disciplinary perspectives, focusing on specific components of the energy consumption system such as technologies or costs. However, early attempts to encourage energy conservation demonstrated that these frameworks often miss important contextual factors such as cultural values and behavioural interactions with technologies. This evidence, combined with the present need for energy policies that can address environmental, social, and economic concerns, suggests that a broader perspective is needed. Integrated frameworks of DEC were first proposed over 20 years ago but very little has been said about the ideas proposed in these papers, whether it be critiquing their form or assessing their impact on theory and practice. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the influence of integrated frameworks in academic literature and in UK energy policy. It is argued that a common language could stimulate renewed interest in the integrated perspective and thereby help policy makers meet these diverse goals. To this end, a flexible agent-based framework is proposed to stimulate debate and clarify the role of an integrated approach to domestic energy policy.},

abstract = {The structure and development of a new state-of-the-art hybrid energy end-use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions model of the Canadian housing stock (CHS), with the capability of accurately determining the effects of renewable energy technologies, is presented. The model incorporates a 17,000 house database developed using the latest data available from the EnerGuide for Houses database, Statistics Canada housing surveys, and other available housing databases. The geometry and thermal envelope of each house is defined in detail, making it suitable for energy simulation based on engineering methods (thermodynamics and heat transfer). The model utilizes the ESP-r building energy simulation program as its simulation engine. To account for effects due to occupant behaviour, a new neural network methodology is utilized to estimate the demographic dependencies of the annual energy consumption of discretionary end-uses such as appliances, lighting and domestic hot water. A new approach is used to allot the annual energy consumption of discretionary end-uses to hourly or sub-hourly intervals based on occupancy, appliance, lighting and domestic hot water load profiles. Each house's profiles are incorporated into the model as loads, a portion of which becomes internal heat gain for inclusion in the space heating/cooling simulation conducted using ESP-r. A new method is used to calculate the GHG emissions from electricity consumption used in the residential sector based on the actual electrical generation fuel mix and the marginal fuel used in each province as a function of the time of year. The developing hybrid model will predict energy consumption and GHG emissions of the CHS based on the latest available stock databases and surveys and uses multiple simulation methods to account for envelope losses and occupant behaviour. When complete, the model may be used to assess the impacts of envelope upgrades or the addition of renewable energy technologies based on high resolution, targeted application.},

First, significant low-cost energy reductions can be made in the residential and commercial sectors, but these savings have not been achievable to date. Second, billions of dollars are being spent to install smart meters, yet the energy saving and financial benefits of this infrastructure – without careful consideration of the human element – will not reach its full potential. We believe that we can address these problems by strategically marrying them, using disaggregation. Disaggregation refers to a set of statistical approaches for extracting end-use and/or appliance level data from an aggregate, or whole-building, energy signal. In this paper, we explain how appliance level data affords numerous benefits, and why using the algorithms in conjunction with smart meters is the most cost-effective and scalable solution for getting this data. We review disaggregation algorithms and their requirements, and evaluate the extent to which smart meters can meet those requirements. Research, technology, and policy recommendations are also outlined.},

In this contribution, we study the optical and energy performance of such window in the fully bleached and fully colored state as well as when it is kept in intermediate states. Different configurations in terms of placement of the EC layer stack and possible additional low-emissivity (low-E) coating within the insulated glass unit are considered. Using optical data and software tools we find that even a small coloration has a significant effect on the energy performance because the solar heat gain coefficient is readily reduced by the absorption of the EC layer stack.

Potential uses of such an application include (but are not be limited to): Provision of an absolute measure of thermal performance (cf. SAP/RdSAP which provide such a measure in a very different way) Provision of information to contextualise data on actual energy consumption and on how behavioural changes or technical changes might lead to energy savings Provision of information to contextualise data on actual energy consumption after particular technical (e.g. retrofit) and/or behavioural changes are adopted The invite-only workshop, which took place in London on 8th November 2016, explored such issues, and much more besides.

Study indicates high {\%} of varience from behavioural aspects
Largest varience for water use - interesting aspect since water very important, often overlooked (historically water supply not been concern in europe, more recently realizing there's actaully a lot of pressure on water supply even in rainy UK). Also easy to user a lot more or less water depending on common habits (turn off tap while brushing teach, not flushing pee, showers vs baths)


TPB results are crap!
Water scatter has 1 point a bit further out on the efficient axis, take that away and the points don't really form any trend at all!

Many factors, such as data analysis skills, quality of recorded data, performance of the analysis tool employed, approximations and hypotheses on the component and its boundary, etc., can influence the results. The work reported in this paper intended to estimate achievable agreement when different analysis approaches are applied to the same and different datasets to find the U value of a given building component. The spread in the results is analysed. To isolate and highlight the effects of the different analysis approaches and test conditions from the effects of other assumptions about the test component and its boundaries, a well-known, quite simple uniform opaque wall was analysed taking direct component level measurements into consideration. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We describe a Bayesian method, for fitting curves to data drawn from an exponential family, that uses splines for which the number and locations of knots are free parameters. The method uses reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to change the knot configurations and a locality heuristic to speed up mixing. For nonnormal models, we approximate the integrated likelihood ratios needed to compute acceptance probabilities by using the Bayesian information criterion, BIC, under priors that make this approximation accurate. Our technique is based on a moginalised chain on the knot number and locations, but we provide methods for inference about the regreesion coefficients, and functions of them, in both normal and nonnormal models. Simulation results suggest that the method performs well, and we illustrate the method in two neuroscience applications},

abstract = {Longwave (infrared) radiation is exchanged between exterior building surfaces, the ground and the sky. This process affects exterior surface temperatures and hence building energy consumption. Current approaches to modelling this exchange in building and microclimate analysis tools are discussed. There are various shortcomings, the most significant concerning radiation exchange between building surfaces at different temperatures. This work implements improvements to the longwave exchange processes in the EnergyPlus simulation engine, allowing improved calculation of surface temperatures and thus of heating and cooling loads. The improvements cover ground temperature assumptions and the coupling of other building surfaces. The coupling of radiative transfer was achieved by means of a timelag; it is shown that for small timesteps this approach is adequate. The new approaches are compared to the existing implementation in EnergyPlus for arrangements including a street canyon and shading devices. The combined impact gave an increase in surface temperature of up to 6°C, with an average change of 2°C. This caused a decrease in annual heating load of 18{\%} and an increase in cooling load of 19{\%}. This confirms the importance of accurate longwave radiation modelling both for buildings in dense urban areas and for buildings with external shading devices.},

abstract = {Energy-consumption data collected from two equipment-retrofit projects before and after the retrofits was used to develop a model that estimates energy savings from retrofit projects. The computation method used in the model is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model integrates weather variables, specific equipment-usage and occupancy data, and building-operation schedules into the pre-retrofit energy-usage pattern. It then estimates the energy usage of the pre-retrofit equipment in the post-retrofit period by using weather data, occupancy, and building-operation schedules in the post-retrofit period. The difference between the recorded energy usage of the post-retrofit equipment and the predicted energy usage of the pre-retrofit equipment in the post-retrofit period is the estimate of energy savings. For the two retrofit projects used in the ANN model, the coefficient of correlation varied from 0.957 to 0.844; the root mean square error varied from 6.81{\%} to 16.4{\%}; and the mean absolute error varied from 5.31{\%} to 9.95{\%}. Additionally, the sensitivity of the model to the input variables was analyzed with one of the retrofit project data. Dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, and time (representing building-occupancy and equipment-operation schedule) were determined as the most effective variables in the ANN model. The research and findings are presented in this paper.},

abstract = {A learning machine--or a model--is usually trained by minimizing a given criterion (the expectation of the cost function), measuring the discrepancy between the model output and the desired output. As is already well known, the choice of the cost function has a profound impact on the probabilistic interpretation of the output of the model, after training. In this work, we use the calculus of variations in order to tackle this problem. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the cost function ensuring that the output of the trained model approximates 1) the conditional expectation of the desired output given the explanatory variables; 2) the conditional median (and, more generally, the q-quantile); 3) the conditional geometric mean; and 4) the conditional variance. The same method could be applied to the estimation of other summary statistics as well. We also argue that the least absolute deviations criterion could, in some cases, act as an alternative to the ordinary least squares criterion for nonlinear regression. In the same vein, the concept of "regression quantile" is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Although the building sector is recognized as having major potential for energy conservation and carbon dioxide emission mitigation, conventional bottom–up and top–down models are limited in their ability to capture the complex economic and technological dynamics of the sector. This paper introduces a hybrid framework developed to assess future household energy demand in France. Res-IRF, a bottom–up module of energy consumption for space heating, has several distinctive features: (i) a clear separation between energy efficiency, i.e. investment in energy efficient technologies, and sufficiency, i.e. changes in the utilization of energy consuming durables which allows the rebound effect to be assessed; (ii) the inclusion of barriers to energy efficiency in the form of intangible costs, consumer heterogeneity parameters and the learning-by-doing process; (iii) an endogenous determination of retrofitting which represents trade-offs between retrofit quantity and quality. Subsequently, Res-IRF is linked to the IMACLIM-R computable general equilibrium model. This exercise shows that, compared to a 37{\%} reduction in final energy demand achievable in business as usual in existing dwellings in 2050, an additional reduction of 21{\%} could be achieved if relevant barriers to efficiency and sufficiency were overcome.},

The duration of monitoring necessary to meet this type of criterion has been calculated for monitoring periods starting at various times of the year, using between 6 and 18 years of radiation data for seven UK sites. The results of this project confirm and extend Everett's original results. They show for example that 'rapid thermal calibration projects', which aim to provide reliable characterisation of house performance from a few weeks of intensive monitoring, should ideally be scheduled to start in late winter or in late summer and autumn. These conclusions are ...},

abstract = {When the heat balance of a building is assessed, the heat needed for the ventilation air is usually calculated according to the intended ventilation rate. However, in order to calculate the air change rate accurately several aspects have to be considered. One important parameter is the ventilation system. Whether the building has a mechanical exhaust-only, supply-only, balanced exhaust–supply or natural ventilation system will influence the air infiltration rate through cracks in the building envelope. High infiltration rates lead to an increase in the heating demand and can result in an inadequate capacity of the designed heating installation. In this paper, computer simulations of the air change rate for a detached single-family house are presented. The house is simulated in different topographical surroundings, equipped with a mechanical exhaust-only, or a balanced exhaust–supply, ventilation system. In addition, the airtightness of the building is varied, from very tight, 1 air change per hour (ACH), to quite leaky, 6 ACH, when pressurized to 50Pa. Results from the simulations show that the same house has quite different air change rates in different surroundings with different airtightness.},

abstract = {Accurately computing solar irradiance on external facades is a prerequisite for reliably predicting thermal behavior and cooling loads of buildings. Validation of radiation models and algorithms implemented in building energy simulation codes is an essential endeavor for evaluating solar gain models. Seven solar radiation models implemented in four building energy simulation codes were investigated: (1) isotropic sky, (2) Klucher, (3) Hay–Davies, (4) Reindl, (5) Muneer, (6) 1987 Perez, and (7) 1990 Perez models. The building energy simulation codes included: EnergyPlus, DOE-2.1E, TRNSYS-TUD, and ESP-r. Solar radiation data from two 25 days periods in October and March/April, which included diverse atmospheric conditions and solar altitudes, measured on the EMPA campus in a suburban area in Duebendorf, Switzerland, were used for validation purposes. Two of the three measured components of solar irradiances – global horizontal, diffuse horizontal and direct-normal – were used as inputs for calculating global irradiance on a south-west fa{\c{c}}ade. Numerous statistical parameters were employed to analyze hourly measured and predicted global vertical irradiances. Mean absolute differences for both periods were found to be: (1) 13.7{\%} and 14.9{\%} for the isotropic sky model, (2) 9.1{\%} for the Hay–Davies model, (3) 9.4{\%} for the Reindl model, (4) 7.6{\%} for the Muneer model, (5) 13.2{\%} for the Klucher model, (6) 9.0{\%}, 7.7{\%}, 6.6{\%}, and 7.1{\%} for the 1990 Perez models, and (7) 7.9{\%} for the 1987 Perez model. Detailed sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo and fitted effects for N-way factorial analyses were applied to assess how uncertainties in input parameters propagated through one of the building energy simulation codes and impacted the output parameter. The implications of deviations in computed solar irradiances on predicted thermal behavior and cooling load of buildings are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of testing BREDEM-8 and BREDEM-12 against measurements in real dwellings and against detailed simulation models. BREDEM-8 is a monthly calculation whereas BREDEM-12 works on a nominal heating season of 8 months. The BREDEM-8 results have been presented before but it is instructive to present them here again because this highlights the performance of the two versions of BREDEM relative to one another. Often all that is required of an energy calculation is a prediction of annual energy use. The results obtained indicate that in this respect the two versions of BREDEM are as good as the detailed simulation models. Both versions of BREDEM perform well in both types of test, and the predictions from the simpler seasonal calculation are as good as those from the more complex monthly calculation. This suggests that for many purposes, and in particular for those where a hand calculation option needs to be available, a seasonal calculation is quite adequate. For example, there is no point in basing an energy label such as the Standard Assessment Procedure on anything more complicated than a seasonal calculation. In situations where a computer would always be used to do the calculations, either a seasonal or a monthly calculation could be employed. The amount of data input is not significantly different in the two cases but the monthly calculation has the advantage that information on seasonal variations is available and this can be important, particularly for passive solar and low energy design purposes.},

annote = {{\#} General comments
NOT VERY GOOD. dodgy writing and stating the obvious (like explaining p-values). Approach is not very exciting, fairly standard (by now) GLM to explore whether given variable is relevant.


Tables with columns of p-value, where all the values are the same - no point copying values like this, can just state in caption. Similarly for R-values, interpretation of raw-value is iffy for GLM (since you are just measuring covariance rather than full blow model fit), care more about whether R is acceptable or not. A lot fo the raw data could have just been an appendix, or otherwise summarized.


Then on the other hand, the explanation of whether each var is important or not, and in what direction, is done in the body text as a sort of splurge, really that is what you want to visualize: variable, significance (e.g. as a {\%} of total impact), direction of influence. Suspect that lack of clearer explanation due to authors themselves being not quite sure what all these metrics really mean (admittedly interpreting things like GLM is hard)




Analysis of Aircon info is much better+in depth, i like it more, it makes more sense generally and tells you useful stuff. Path analysis also important


Motivation
---------


Building stock large, globally account for 30-40{\%} consumption, changes slowly
Surveys like the RECS used to calibrate bottom up models using building phyics or top-down studies of trends


Aim
---


Assess role of behaviour




Method
------


Use USA RECS consumption survey data - detailed building properties and actual consumption


RECS 2001, 4822 dewllings in 50 states, personal interviews, building survey, energy consumption
excluded mobile homes, dwellings used for business, etc, reduced to 3358


Used gaussian analysis, tested each dimension for skewness and kurtosis - where these were too far off desired, did a *square-root transform to improve normality* (??)


Used General Linear Model to get relationship between variables




Results
------


Separating out climate, socioeconomic and behavioural components are important


Reported frequency of aircon use accounts for 47{\%} variation in cooling energy
- actually surprising, might expect more. This is not precisely a behavioural impact though - simply using aircon in hot climates is not any more behavioural that using heating in cold climates. Behaviour is more like choices of when to turn it on, how long to use it, different ways people might deal with heat (e.g. above certain temps people might be more likely to leave for holidays, live outside, etc. choice is big mix of socioeconomic, location, culture...)},

Sampling strategy important for external validity - so that people in study match people who will be included in wider rollout






Sample design important, affects size of study needed for statistical significance
Seet Table of sizes needed for impact detection limit 1{\%} depending on number of pre/post measurements and ratio of treatment to control




Recommend panel data regression analysis


important, if you have variables that you don't observe you cant use them as independant variables even if they might explain variation. panel data allows you to pick out time dependant and time independant factors


Use panel data estimators to account for unobservable factors that vary across individuals but not time
- fixed effects and random effects estimators


Error term u must have an expected value of 0 ={\textgreater} E(u | X) =0 ={\textgreater} not related to independant variables (variables who's effect you don't want to measure for)


Fixed effects - factor out non time variant parameters
Random effects- assume some uncorrelated error term

@article{Newsham2010,
abstract = {Peak demand for electricity in North America is expected to grow, challenging electrical utilities to supply this demand in a cost-effective, reliable manner. Therefore, there is growing interest in strategies to reduce peak demand by eliminating electricity use, or shifting it to non-peak times. This strategy is commonly called “demand response”. In households, common strategies are time-varying pricing, which charge more for energy use on peak, or direct load control, which allows utilities to curtail certain loads during high demand periods. We reviewed recent North American studies of these strategies. The data suggest that the most effective strategy is a critical peak price (CPP) program with enabling technology to automatically curtail loads on event days. There is little evidence that this causes substantial hardship for occupants, particularly if they have input into which loads are controlled and how, and have an override option. In such cases, a peak load reduction of at least 30{\%} is a reasonable expectation. It might be possible to attain such load reductions without enabling technology by focusing on household types more likely to respond, and providing them with excellent support. A simple time-of-use (TOU) program can only expect to realise on-peak reductions of 5{\%}.},

The authors argue that conventional distinctions between research, development and the deployment of technologies are inappropriate for the built environment. A wider range of approaches to research is needed to enable researchers to engage more effectively with stakeholders throughout the research, development, and deployment process, to reduce the distinction between research and knowledge transfer, and to reduce the length of learning cycles.

abstract = {The building stock has a decisive impact on energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sustainable development of urban areas. In previous studies the authors have assessed these impacts by applying a bottom up building stock model (BSM) including construction components and energy systems for different development scenarios. The goal of this work is to present novel improvements of the BSM which include a spatial differentiation of building characteristics, energy infrastructure and local potentials of renewable energy. As such the model is suitable to be used in the context of urban energy planning and to simulate different scenarios, for instance with regard to the feasibility of long term carbon mitigation and (primary) energy consumption reduction goals. To simulate energy demand, carbon emissions and further key indicators of the building stock the bottom-up simulation methodology has been enhanced in terms of spatial differentiation. So far, to deal with the great complexity of building stock modelling, different building types of an urban context have been clustered into cohorts with similar characteristics. As compared to these earlier approaches, we combine specific data known on the level of each individual building with generic data that is known or assumed on the level of building or spatial cohorts. These cohorts are defined by variables such as construction period, building type and utilisation, and building location. However, model calculations are done on the level of specific building archetypes, building technologies, and building components. As such assumptions on technical characteristics and building stock alterations may be brought much closer to the decision processes. This new approach of spatial building stock modelling (SBSM) offers the advantage of being able to include specific, geo-referenced building data (e.g. from surveys or from building registers) and to represent results at the level of details needed. Hence, results may be represented by building type or other building attributes, but also by hectare or neighbourhoods, using geographical information systems (GIS). Scientific results are achieved both with regard to methodology and with regard to content. Methodologically we demonstrate the feasibility of combining data and assumptions on different levels of aggregation such as building elements, individual buildings and cohorts. With regard to content we present results from a case study about feasibility of achieving the goals of the 2000-Watt- and 1-ton-CO2-society in the city of Zurich, referring to spatially differentiated potentials of renewable energy and energy-efficiency.},

These documents provide an overview of fuel poverty, describing the evidence linking fuel poverty, cold homes, and poor health outcomes. They examine the scale of the problem across England and trends over time. Evidence shows that living in cold homes is associated with poor health outcomes and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality for all age groups. The documents also provide a brief overview of national policy and sets out the role of local authorities and potential interventions at local level. Fuel poverty is not just about poverty, but also about the quality of England's housing stock and energy efficiency. The review discusses some of the interventions that have been implemented at the local level to help people on low incomes during cold weather and to address cold home-related health problems. The full evidence review and a shorter summary briefing are available to download above. This document is part of a series.

The past decades have seen significant improvements in building energy efficiency through the introduction of new building regulations and the construction of low energy buildings. However, the expected energy reduction has not been observed, largely due to the complicated and hard-to-predict nature of occupant behavior. This paper explores the impact of occupants on residential energy consumption in China. Surveys related to behavior and energy use in the city of Hangzhou were collected in the winter (n=642) and summer (n=838). Findings show that occupant age is a more significant factor than income. Contrary to existing research, a negative correlation between occupant age and energy consumption was found in this study. Elderly residents exhibit a more frugal behavior pattern than the younger ones. In addition, this paper reveals that household socio-economic and behavior variables are able to explain 28.8{\%} of the variation in heating and cooling energy consumption.},

abstract = {Financial data has been extensively studied for correlations using Pearson's cross-correlation coefficient $\rho$ as the point of departure. We employ an estimator based on recurrence plots — the correlation of probability of recurrence (CPR) — to analyze connections between nine stock indices spread worldwide. We suggest a slight modification of the CPR approach in order to get more robust results. We examine trends in CPR for an approximately 19-month window moved along the time series and compare them to trends in $\rho$. Binning CPR into three levels of connectedness (strong, moderate, and weak), we extract the trends in number of connections in each bin over time. We also look at the behavior of CPR during the dot-com bubble by shifting the time series to align their peaks. CPR mainly uncovers that the markets move in and out of periods of strong connectivity erratically, instead of moving monotonically towards increasing global connectivity. This is in contrast to $\rho$, which gives a picture of ever-increasing correlation. CPR also exhibits that time-shifted markets have high connectivity around the dot-com bubble of 2000. We use significance tests using twin surrogates to interpret all the measures estimated in the study.},

abstract = {We compared Home Energy Rating Systems (HERS) ratings and actual utility billing data for about 500 houses in four states. We found that HERS can, on average, predict annual energy cost accurately. However, on an individual house basis the agreement between predicted energy cost and actual energy cost was often poor, especially for older houses. Discrepancies between predicted and actual energy use have important implications for the true cost-effectiveness of HERS-recommended improvements. There was no clear relationship between rating score and actual energy cost. Given these results, HERS providers need to give consumers more information about accuracy and how to interpret ratings. They should also take greater advantage of the thousands of ratings that have been conducted in order to assess and improve HERS' ability to predict energy use.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new approach to online forecasting of power production from PV systems. The method is suited to online forecasting in many applications and in this paper it is used to predict hourly values of solar power for horizons of up to 36h. The data used is 15-min observations of solar power from 21 PV systems located on rooftops in a small village in Denmark. The suggested method is a two-stage method where first a statistical normalization of the solar power is obtained using a clear sky model. The clear sky model is found using statistical smoothing techniques. Then forecasts of the normalized solar power are calculated using adaptive linear time series models. Both autoregressive (AR) and AR with exogenous input (ARX) models are evaluated, where the latter takes numerical weather predictions (NWPs) as input. The results indicate that for forecasts up to 2h ahead the most important input is the available observations of solar power, while for longer horizons NWPs are the most important input. A root mean square error improvement of around 35{\%} is achieved by the ARX model compared to a proposed reference model.},

abstract = {One of the cheapest ways to reduce CO2 emissions is thermal renovation of existing homes. Germany is a world leader in this project, with a strict building code, generous state subsidies, and an advanced renovation infrastructure. The effects of its policies are here explored in the light of progressive tightening of the building code, and the strict criteria for subsidies. Data on costs and outcomes of residential building renovations are presented from published reports on renovation projects, and cross-checked with projects investigated directly. Comparisons are made in terms of euros invested for every kilowatt hour of heating energy saved over the lifetime of the renovations, for standards ranging from 150kWh (the lowest standard) to 15kWh (the highest) of primary energy use per square metre of floor area per year. It is found that the lowest standard is an order of magnitude more cost-effective than the highest, in terms of both energy saved per euro invested, and return on investment over the lifetime of the renovations, regardless of fuel prices. It is argued that this throws into question Germany's policy of progressively regulating for higher renovation standards, and offering subsidies only for projects that go beyond the minimum standard.},

abstract = {Computer models of building energy use, if calibrated with measured data, offer a means of assessing retrofit savings, optimizing HVAC operation (on- or off-line), and presenting energy-consumption feedback to building operators. The calibration process itself can pinpoint differences between how a building was designed to perform and how it is actually functioning. Our initial goal was to identify why the actual annual energy consumption of an office building was 325 kWh/m2, over twice the predicted value of 125 kWh/m2. Part of our effort to understand its performance involved calibrating a DOE-2 model prepared at the design stage. In the process, we formulated calibration guidelines and developed insights that may be of use to others. Of particular interest are the major sources of the wide discrepancy between predicted and actual energy use. Unanticipated tenant energy consumption, both during the day and the night, contributed 64{\%} of the two-fold increase. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment operation beyond the expected 10 h per weekday contributed 24{\%}. We attributed the remaining 12{\%} to HVAC equipment not operating up to specification; building conductive heat loss in excess of the design-stage prediction; and minimum outdoor-air intake differing from the design value. The calibration process involved working on major input parameters independently of the others, then combining the results into one simulation. The calibrated model accounted for 94{\%} of measured site energy for the building. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {This study into fuel consumption across the English housing stock used meter reading data from the 2001 EHCS and subsequent follow up readings taken in early 2003. It is important to stress that the study focussed strictly on gas and electricity consumption as no data was available for non-metered fuel sources. Throughout the report the phrase combined consumption will always represent the total gas and electricity consumption and will include dwellings with no gas present. Where gas or electricity consumptions are analysed individually, this will be stated explicitly. The mean combined gas and electricity consumption in 2002 was 22,290 kWh household, the mean gas consumption was 19,788 kWh household and the mean electricity consumption was 5,282 kWh household. Owner occupiers had the highest combined and gas consumptions, whilst households in private rented dwellings consumed the most electricity. Electric heating was found to be more predominant in the latter than in other tenures. Of the dwelling types, the highest consumptions were found in categories that are typically larger and have higher potential for heat loss such as detached and semi-detached dwellings. Smaller dwellings in the private rented sector have particularly high electricity consumptions, caused by the large proportion of electrically heated dwellings in this category. Comparing consumption by dwelling age shows that combined and gas consumptions are at their highest in older (pre-WW II) dwellings and decrease as the construction date becomes more recent. Electricity consumption was roughly comparable across the range of construction dates. The highest combined and gas consumptions occur in dwellings with mid range SAP ratings, with consumption decreasing among higher SAP ratings due to the improved energy efficiency in these dwellings. The lowest SAP scores also coincide with low combined consumption but these dwellings have the highest electricity consumption, reflecting the reliance on electric heating of these households. Larger households are consuming more of each type of fuel, with single people consuming the lowest amount. A strong correlation between consumption and income can be seen with a high income corresponding with a higher consumption. Households not in fuel poverty had higher combined and gas consumptions but lower electric consumption than those in fuel poverty. This trend was particularly strong in smaller dwellings and the private rented sector. Again, households in fuel poverty were more reliant on electricity for primary heating requirements. Between 1996 and 2001, total gas and electricity consumptions increased by 17{\%} and 22{\%} respectively. Comparing individual categories with 1996, households with the lowest incomes saw the largest increase in gas and electricity consumptions with fuel use in the largest dwellings falling slightly. Older households saw the largest increase in gas consumption.},

abstract = {Building cooling load prediction is one of the key factors in the success of energy-saving measures. Many computational models available in the industry have been developed from either forward or inverse modeling approaches. However, these models usually require extensive computer resources and lengthy computation. This paper discusses the use of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, one of the artificial neural network (ANN) models widely adopted in engineering applications, to estimate the cooling load of a building. The training samples used include weather data obtained from the Hong Kong Observatory and building-related data acquired from an existing prestigious commercial building in Hong Kong that houses a mega complex and operates 24h a day. The paper also discusses the practical difficulties encountered in acquiring building-related data. In contrast to other studies that use ANN models to predict building cooling load, this paper includes the building occupancy rate as one of the input parameters used to determine building cooling load. The results demonstrate that the building occupancy rate plays a critical role in building cooling load prediction and significantly improves predictive accuracy.},

M{\&}V has a dual role. First, it quantifies the savings being obtained. Since the persistence of savings has been shown to decrease with time,1 long-term M{\&}V provides data to make these savings sustainable. Second, M{\&}V must be cost effective so that the cost of measurement and the analysis does not consume the savings.2, 3 Currently, a goal of about 5{\%} of the savings per year has evolved as a preferred criteria for costing M{\&}V, since the cost justification directly results from the savings obtained. The general procedure involves a selection of using a monthly billing analysis, a daily or hourly procedure, a component isolation analysis, or a calibrated simulation. Calibrated simulations are usually expensive and difficult to complete.

The focus is on small consumers connected to the low voltage (LV) grid, e.g. a single household. The algorithm is based on either given measurements or synthetically generated bottom-up load profiles as well as a known average load profile. The data are statistically analysed and described in cumulative probability functions (CDF). By employing random numbers that conform to the CDF, both active and reactive power high resolution load profiles can be generated. The presented method is fast-acting and is therefore appropriate for generating large numbers of load profiles. In contrast to a bottom-up approach, it is also applicable if no or only little information about the consumer is available.},

----


Top-down estimation of load profiles, to make up for lack of home energy data.


Use statistical load generator based on Richardson et al for UK, adjusted for Europe patterns - need a set of measurements to use as a base and then make use of for general process.




Need to use 15min load profile since, based on analysis, load doesn't vary much in 15 minute intervals.


Modelling power histogram using existing functions or superpositions is not successful.


Instead, integrate to produce empirical Comulative Distribution Function (CDF) - similar to Adrian and Rajopal},

abstract = {The UK Government has unveiled an ambitious retrofit programme that seeks significant improvement to the energy efficiency of the housing stock. High quality data on the energy efficiency of buildings and their related energy demand is critical to supporting and targeting investment in energy efficiency. Using existing home improvement programmes over the past 15 years, the UK Government has brought together data on energy efficiency retrofits in approximately 13 million homes into the Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED), along with annual metered gas and electricity use for the period of 2004–2007. This paper describes the HEED sample and assesses its representativeness in terms of dwelling characteristics, the energy demand of different energy performance levels using linked gas and electricity meter data, along with an analysis of the impact retrofit measures has on energy demand. Energy savings are shown to be associated with the installation of loft and cavity insulation, and glazing and boiler replacement. The analysis illustrates this source of ‘in-action' data can be used to provide empirical estimates of impacts of energy efficiency retrofit on energy demand and provides a source of empirical data from which to support the development of national housing energy efficiency retrofit policies.},
annote = {HEED database (Home Energy Efficiency Database)


Analyse effect of historical interventions in order to better plan


HEED collects approx 13million dwellings, various sources of information, so varying detail per dwelling. data from 1995 to 2012


From 1970 to 2008 per capita energy demand lighting and appliances increase 88{\%}, space heating peaked in 1980s, dropped 8{\%}


total delivered energy grown 30{\%}, peaked 2004


2010, domestic delivered energy was approx 33{\%} of TFEC, gas 70{\%} elec 23{\%}


SAP rating increased from 17.6 in 1970 to 54.7 in 2010
(something of confirmation bias danger here, SAP developed to both inform and measure improvements, so improvements made will be particuarly focused on increasing SAP rating. So if SAP doesn't match real installation or use in an important way you might have a big delta)




Data - last in depth survey 1994. follow up 2001 not released due to issues (cant even use data somehow?)
2011-2012 update should be good, not out yet


methodology
used HEED data and
energy supplier annualised meter point gas and elec


govt gets data from energy suppliers, we get it thru decc
Some meters have daily or half hourly, use yearly for now


Gas meter data has no user ID - simply class residential as less than 73.2MWh/yr according to DECC 2009b


data converted to annual using readings at least 6mth apart, estimate for missing values
Values are ALREADY adjusted for weather according to OFGEM method to allow year to year comparisons. includes weather and weather sensitivity parameters.
={\textgreater} note these are kind fudge factors, but official ones so i guess we'll live with it


use cleaned data in all analysis
={\textgreater} good to know more about cleaning process!


check coverage of english housing stock by comparing with other datasets, EHS, VOA


gas + elec analysed by physical characteristics


={\textgreater}question on matching, not clear if real matching, finding data for corresponding house, or assigning data based on house having corresponding characteristics e.g. get energydata set for "a 4 bed house" and get meter readings for "a 4 bed house" and stick them together?


Control buildings in HEED - selected as a standard build, ignore possiblity of DIY improvements


Results
--------


HEED is not statistically representative of English stock for selected variables


various descriptive stats - come back when u need to know numbers
LOTS of tables, generally give level of savings, breakdown of population of dataset.


find savings with installations.


note long tail of elec consumption
note gas is classified by consumption, elec by user type and tariff, so elec only includes domestic, gas might include industrial


energy demand goes up for more detatched houses.


conclusion
-------------


HEED represents bout 50{\%} of housing stock. should get better as data coverage grows.
under representation of buildings with no interventions, makes comparisons harder
over representation of types targeted by gov policy - vulnerable homes, certain types of buildings, etc


HEED is just a snapshot of building at a time, not dyanmic.


most change in demand from cavity wall insulation. less from windows and lofts


loft insulation cud be encouraged through DIY, DECC2012b


HEED is in-action data, not result of single campaign. interesting as it brings many things together


HEED informs building of NEED},

abstract = {Better prediction, characterization and quality assurance of actual building energy performance is essential to realise the anticipated world wide energy reductions in buildings and community systems. Quantifying the actual performance of buildings can only be effectively realised by optimized in-situ measurements combined with dynamic data analysis techniques. This project is advancing the development of in-use monitoring for buildings to obtain reliable quality checks of routine building construction practice to guarantee that designed performance is obtained on site. The project will focus on residential buildings, both at the level of individual dwellings, as well as at the community level. At the building level, methodologies to assess and characterise occupied buildings, controlled with the buildings' own services will be explored. Compared to the current assessment methods, this means that the intrusive, dedicated tests are left behind in favour of assessment methods based on on-board monitoring systems. At the aggregated level (to be interpreted as a cluster of individual dwellings, be it an apartment building, a small neighbourhood or a district) the aim is to develop procedures to assess large – but often rather crude – data sets that allow the identification of opportunities at the stock level. At both levels the development of characterisation methods will be explored, as well as of quality assurance methods. The project objectives are: – support the development of replicable characterisation and quality assurance methodologies embedded in a statistical and building physical framework to characterise and assess the actual energy performance of buildings, and – disaggregate the building energy use to its three main sources: building fabric, systems and users. The planned deliverables from this project are: – dynamic data sets (at different scales: individual building and district levels) that can be used for developing dynamic data analysis procedures and for validation purposes, – a series of reports covering the following topics: reliability of input data for onsite building performance assessment, dynamic data analysis methods that can be used to disaggregate occupant influences / fabric and systems at the building level, case studies at the building level, data analysis methods applicable at the district level, case studies at the district level, guidelines (possibilities and limitations) to apply the methods in quality assessment procedures – collaboration with Dynastee, the network of excellence on full scale testing and dynamic data analysis. The project beneficiaries will be: – the building research community and associated specialists (for example energy providers), – engineering consultancies, – building designers and the construction industry interested in high performance systems, and – policy and decision makers involved in developing standards and building performance evaluation.},

In order to evaluate these potentials in an economic and accurate manner, it is essential to have numerical models and simulation tools which correctly reproduce the behaviour of such components at the building level. This paper presents and discusses the empirical validation of models for thermo-tropic glazing, a specific adaptive transparent glazing, by means of a whole building performance simulation tool, EnergyPlus. Moreover, this study highlights the differences between two modelling approaches (EnergyPlus built-in and EMS models) and experimental data. Negligible differences are noted between the two modelling approaches, even though the models do not completely agree with experimental data unless a model calibration is performed. The EMS modelling approach could be successfully extended to other dynamic glazing technologies that do not have a built-in model available in EnergyPlus, provided that an accurate thermo-optical characterisation of the dynamic glazing is available.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results from a case study on the role in policymaking of UK Energy Sector Indicators (ESIs), introduced by the government in 2003. The findings show that the ESIs constituted a very minor element within the broader evidence-base used by policymakers, and that this indicator set and its objectives were poorly known even to central players in the sector. The findings of this research provide further evidence for the observation that scientific knowledge (including evaluations, assessments and indicators) seldom play an instrumental role in policymaking, and are more likely to produce indirect, conceptual and political impacts. The analysis provides a number of tentative conclusions concerning such potential indirect impacts that accrue mainly through processes of dialogue and argumentation both during the preparation of the indicators and after their publication as part of the annual reporting by the UK energy department. The ESIs have played various conceptual and political roles, yet the concrete outcomes in terms of policy change remain to be explored. The conclusions highlight the limitations of rationalist notions of direct, instrumental use in the efforts to understand the role of indicators in policymaking. The paper concludes by three tentative propositions concerning the explanations to the absence of instrumental role of the ESIs, which could be usefully explored in future research: the characteristics of the energy sector; the characteristics of the UK policy culture; and the exceptionality of the ESIs in the general evidence-base of UK energy sector.},

abstract = {A new learning algorithm is proposed for piecewise regression modeling. It employs the technique of deterministic annealing to design space partition regression functions. While the performance of traditional space partition regression functions such as CART and MARS is limited by a simple tree-structured partition and by a hierarchical approach for design, the deterministic annealing algorithm enables the joint optimization of a more powerful piecewise structure based on a Voronoi partition. The new method is demonstrated to achieve consistent performance improvements over regular CART as well as over its extension to allow arbitrary hyperplane boundaries. Comparison tests, on several benchmark data sets from the regression literature, are provided},

abstract = {Narrow-band dm-spikes observed during the June 15, 1991 flare are statistically analysed. The character of their frequency distributions at 237, 327, 408 and 610 MHz in both L- and R-handed circular polarizations is studied. While for the complete time intervals no simple distributions of spikes (either exponential or power-law) are recognized, for shorter intervals both exponential and power-law distributions are observed. No significant difference is found in the distributions for L- and R-polarized data. Further analysis reveals that spikes appearing in dense groups and with high intensities preferentially have exponential distributions, while the sparse spikes with lower intensities are rather characterized by power-law distribution functions with high exponents. Groups of independent spikes (cases with low rates and low intensities) have power-law distributions trend in agreement with the coherent spike mechanisms. Tests are provided regarding statistical analyses. The nonlinear analysis reveals that the degree of complexity of the system varies. It decreases when the attractor dimensions and the Lyapunov exponents assume smaller values, which happens when very strong spikes are present. The changing characteristics of the statistical parameters are probably the result of a mutual interaction in the source environment or a product of propagation conditions.},

abstract = {Low insulation standards and obsolete heating systems of a large amount of buildings in Europe account for disproportional energy consumption. Within this project, the holistic renovation and the results from the monitoring activity of buildings from a field test, located in Southern Germany, are presented. The buildings, built at the end of the 1950s, have been retrofitted with seven different refurbishment layouts. The layouts differ in insulation and engineering system. An installed monitoring system collects thermal indoor environmental conditions and air quality conditions in rooms, as well as data about energy flows at delivery, distribution, storage and generation level, at high time resolution. The monitoring system allows a comparison between the real and the expected energy consumption of the buildings. The energy performance gap was identified and quantified for each refurbishment solution (with values up to 287{\%} based on calculated savings): on average, the energy performance gap of the entire field test varied from 117{\%} in 2011, 107{\%} in 2012, 41{\%} in 2013 and 60{\%} in 2014. The occupants' behavior has been identified as one of the causes for the energy performance gap. Further causes are mistakes in the installation, and malfunctioning of the engineering system. The importance of a monitoring system for buildings with a complex engineering system was confirmed.},

@article{Theodorou2011,
abstract = {The propagation stage of uncertainty evaluation, known as the propagation of distributions, is in most cases approached by the GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) uncertainty framework which is based on the law of propagation of uncertainty assigned to various input quantities and the characterization of the measurand (output quantity) by a Gaussian or a t-distribution. Recently, a Supplement to the ISO-GUM was prepared by the JCGM (Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology). This Guide gives guidance on propagating probability distributions assigned to various input quantities through a numerical simulation (Monte Carlo Method) and determining a probability distribution for the measurand. In the present work the two approaches were used to estimate the uncertainty of the direct determination of cadmium in water by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). The expanded uncertainty results (at 95{\%} confidence levels) obtained with the GUM Uncertainty Framework and the Monte Carlo Method at the concentration level of 3.01 $\mu$g/L were ±0.20 $\mu$g/L and ±0.18 $\mu$g/L, respectively. Thus, the GUM Uncertainty Framework slightly overestimates the overall uncertainty by 10{\%}. Even after taking into account additional sources of uncertainty that the GUM Uncertainty Framework considers as negligible, the Monte Carlo gives again the same uncertainty result (±0.18 $\mu$g/L). The main source of this difference is the approximation used by the GUM Uncertainty Framework in estimating the standard uncertainty of the calibration curve produced by least squares regression. Although the GUM Uncertainty Framework proves to be adequate in this particular case, generally the Monte Carlo Method has features that avoid the assumptions and the limitations of the GUM Uncertainty Framework.},

abstract = {Today the implication of buildings' electricity demand on the outdoor climate around buildings is not fully understood. For tropical cities like Singapore, where air-conditioning is required throughout the year and high rise buildings irregularly alternate with lower buildings, the distribution of this so called anthropogenic heat emissions in time and space is determining the local and overall contribution to the urban heat island (UHI). In the absence of detailed measurements calculating the local consumption can be challenging. We present a methodology which combines a top-down disaggregation of sectoral electricity consumption with a bottom-up geographic information system (GIS) derived building database for obtaining anthropogenic heat emission maps with high spatial resolution. The database has been validated through control samples. Using the example of Singapore we can show that heat emissions are more inhomogeneous and higher in magnitude than previously estimated. Our method can now be employed to generate better UHI models by identifying areas with significant anthropogenic heat emissions.},

Within this context, the paper focuses on the energy savings that may occur when using electrochromic (EC) windows, an interesting emerging technology alternative to shading devices to control solar gain in buildings located in Mediterranean climates. The EC windows technology is briefly presented and the optical properties adjustments of the glasses are discussed according to the operated range. The EC window dynamic behavior and the different control strategies are modeled and implemented in the ESP-r building simulation program. The EC window impact in the energy needs for heating and cooling is studied, considering different ambient parameters (exterior dry bulb temperature, interior dry bulb temperature and incident radiation) and set points for the EC control. A comparison of several windows solutions (single, double-glazing and EC windows), the type of building, internal gains from occupancy, lighting and equipment and the orientation of windows are considered for discussion through the analysis of the energy needs for heating and cooling. It is concluded that for this climate the best positive results are obtained when the EC are used in the west fa{\c{c}}ade. For the south fa{\c{c}}ade the results show no significant advantages in using EC windows. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The paper reviews the concept of DSM, outlines the historical impacts of DSM globally since the energy crises of the 1970s, analyses UK DSM policy, and examines the influence of EU Directives on UK DSM policy, as the country is currently deciding on how to include the demand-side in its Electricity Market Reform proposals and wider energy policy. Much of the focus of previous research has been on DSM technological trials and modelling studies rather than DSM policy and the paper contributes to filling this gap. Policy recommendations for the UK context are discussed, and it is clear that the success of DSM policies is determined primarily by regulatory support and utility financial incentives. It is important that policy clarity is provided and that current and new policies do not overlap.},

@article{Flach2014,
abstract = {This work presents data mining methods for discovering unusual consumption patterns and their associated descriptive models from smart electricity meter data. At present, data mining and knowledge discovery in electricity meter data suffer from three notable weaknesses: 1) insufficient focus on intelligent data analysis of subgroups (subsets) whose patterns vary significantly from aggregate patterns embodied in an entire dataset; 2) a lack of effort towards generating intuitively understandable and practically applicable knowledge for industrial practitioners to identify such subgroups; and 3) limited knowledge regarding the link between unusual consumption patterns and household consumers' socio-demographic characteristics. This paper addresses these practically important but technically challenging issues by applying subgroup discovery algorithms to a real smart electricity meter dataset. Subgroups whose patterns are unusual and whose sizes are large enough are discovered, and their descriptive and predictive models are generated. Furthermore, to enrich subgroup discovery algorithms, three new-quality measures for real-valued targets are proposed. The comparative studies empirically evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of subgroup discovery on classification accuracy, predictive power, and computational resources. The methodologies and algorithms presented are generic, and therefore applicable to a wider range of data mining problems.},

abstract = {Results are presented from a monitoring study of the electricity consumption of a sample of UK domestic buildings. Five-minutely average whole house power consumption was recorded for 72 dwellings at five sites over a 2-year monitoring period. The mean annual electricity consumption for the households increased significantly by 4.5{\%} (t=1.9; p{\textless}0.05, one-tailed) from the first to the second year of monitoring. New techniques are developed which estimate the electricity consumption of different appliance groups, based on analysis of the five-minutely monitored data. The overall increase in electricity consumption is attributed to a 10.2{\%} increase in the consumption of ‘standby' appliances (such as televisions and consumer electronics) and a 4.7{\%} increase in the consumption of ‘active' appliance (such as lighting, kettles and electric showers). The consumption of different energy user groups (low, medium and high) is also investigated and low and high users are identified as contributing to the overall increase in consumption. The need for further investigation, such as quantitative and qualitative studies, to improve understanding in domestic electricity consumption is discussed.},

 can be treated as a network of many investors reacting in accordance to their group behaviour, as
 manifested by the index and effected by the flow of external information into the system. Here we
 devise a model that encapsulates the behaviour of stock markets. The model consists of two terms,
 demonstrating quantitatively the effect of the individual tendency to follow the group and the
 effect of the individual reaction to the available information. Using the above factors we were able
 to explain several key features of the stock market: the high correlations between the individual
 stocks and the index; the Epps effect; the high fluctuating nature of the market, which is similar
 to real market behaviour. Furthermore, intricate long term phenomena are also described by this
 model, such as bursts of synchronized average correlation and the dominance of the index as
 demonstrated through partial correlation.},

It develops a framework for addressing key questions about human behaviors that harm the environment, summarizes knowledge from psychology and related fields about these behaviors, and uses that knowledge to point the way to realistic solutions. This book develops a framework for addressing these questions, drawing on behavioral theory, real world case studies, field experiments, and other evidence. Because its central focus is individual behavior, it draws most heavily on concepts from social, cognitive, and behavioral psychology. However, it puts behavior in the context of the economic, institutional, and policy forces that shape it and emphasizes arenas where individual action makes a real difference to the natural environment. The result is an interdisciplinary treatment, rooted in behavioral science but addressing practical issues of environmental policy. The book is written at a level suitable for undergraduate students in psychology, social science, and environmental studies and science.},

Bayesian methods, including the Bayesian information criterion, are also mentioned in the context of the framework outlined in the paper. The ideas are illustrated using an example in which observations are available for the entire population of interest. This enables us to examine and to measure effects that are usually invisible, because in practical applications only a sample from the population is observed.

- Useful, but important to remember that standards and behaviour are different.


! For a given energy rating, can have 600{\%} spread of actual comsumption (most consuming is 6x least consuming)


Also found in Switzerland, France, Austria, Netherlands, Denmark


Intro
----
Model the distribution of proportional differences between calculated energy rating and actual measured consumption


* aim to show the characteristics of water and space heating, EPR vs measured


Actual consumption
-----------------
Knissel 2006 - can measured data extrapolate back to an EPR
Greller 2010, Loga 2011 - building topologies


3400 dwellings with precise EPR data


Avg EPR 225 kWh/m2 per yr
range 15 to 400


Avg MEASURED is about 150kWh/m2 per yr (different studies) - 30{\%} BELOW EPR


Higher EPR (expected energy use) -{\textgreater} actual use is proportionally lower (i.e. the more you are expected to use, the bigger the {\%} below EPR you are)


={\textgreater} TODO: match plots for UK data with energy use vs SAP (use part of sap that gives estimated energy before fucking around with cost and co2 ratings)




={\textgreater} NOTE: assigns difference to "behavioural effects". Still seems to default to this explanation.


Can calculate {\%} increase in energy use for {\%} decrease in energy performance (+ 0.2-0.5{\%} for + 1{\%} calc energy requ)


Low energy buildings have opposite trend, use more than expected.


={\textgreater} Maybe there's something general, probably obivious, that's missing in all models, since this seems to be a trend - bad houses are better than thought, good houses are worse. Maybe something like assuming no heating required in summer or similar.


={\textgreater} on the other hand, data is noisy.
={\textgreater} Could simply be that no one knows how to build a low energy house properly, so none of them are really built to spec. You would expect performance to be close to EPR rating for new build because they are built to comply with rating in first place.
={\textgreater}NB germany does have less compliance problems in construction


Passivhouses (esp small ones) however are much closer to EPR
={\textgreater} expensive, maybe built by specialised builders?
={\textgreater} design is just more robust to adverse effects? Advantage of passive systems...




Note - german standard indoor temp is 19°C




Explanations
-----------
Hard to integrate heating patterns
could be problem in mode


Prebound
--------
on avg 30{\%} less than expected


‘prebound' effect refers to the situation before a retrofit, and indicates how much less energy is consumed than expected.


* Retrofits can't save energy that wasn't consumed


Loga et al equation using data fit to estimate {\%} consumption below EPR from given EPR


Other countries
-------------
Dutch Tighelaar {\&} Menkveld 2011, 4700dwell, found same effect
"heating factor" 0.7 == prebound 30{\%}


UK Kelly 2011 EHCS 2531 dwell (SEM paper) - high SAP (higher is better) also use more energy. Costs of improvments for high SAP larger because of diminishing returns.


Belgium Hens et al 2010 Worked with W/m3K - avg U value of envelop divided by vol times area. Makes no assumptions about heating habits.
Uses energy per unit volume m3 instead of m2 - account for room heights
Also found prebound
={\textgreater} ! These energy/volume and heatloss/volume measure may be much better choices as ML features than others used previously.
={\textgreater} Compactness C = vol/area is interesting concept for simple analysis of fabric loss.


French Cayre et al 2011 - fr EPC measures MWh/dwelling per yr
relate EPC to proportion of income spent on heating
={\textgreater}guess it makes sense in policy, but don't like mashing in these cost/income views, muddies waters, results change meaning with inflation adjustment blah blah. try to stick to invariant physical units for primary results!


use energy intensity in similar way to prebound- intensity 1 == use exactly as much as rated.
median 0.6 - prebound 40{\%}




Implications
----------
if fuel use is lower than expected, this screws up calculations.
={\textgreater}note - if everyone is using less than expected then what about the total fuel consumption? We should know how much fuel is sold...


major savings still needed, but if starting at better point marginal costs will be higher


* see calculation for estimate of cost per ton co2 - cost doubles if real saving is halved
* need compare cost to modernizing grid, might be cheaper to clean energy sources instead
* consider economic incentives


Note that price eleasticity for energy varies quite a lot between countries it seems, -0.35 to 0.65 netherlands, denmark, uk - 2007 study. Summerfield 2010 found -0.20 (quite a bit lower!)




Effect of people managing heating budgets




Conclusion
-----------
Home efficiency improvement targets might not be met by simply tightening thermal retrofit standards
={\textgreater} note, refers to "deeper" do they just specfiy insulation depth??


Maybe need for behavioural improvements instead
={\textgreater} this is for germany mind, homes pretty decent. UK case has a lot of very terrible homes to begin with, guessing still a lot of technical potential},

BREDEM-1 is a simple single-zone model designed for hand calculations; its predictive capabilities have been tested on a group of over forty dwellings2. Major extensions to the BREDEM-1 model to include two zones and also incorporating changes to the way in which internal and external temperatures are handled, resulted in BREDEM-23. Like its predecessor, BREDEM-2 is designed for hand calculations, although a number of closely related computer based versions have been developed. These are also called BREDEM and are given individual identification numbers. This paper tests the predictions of BREDEM-5 (also known as Energy Auditor) using the same sample as was used for BREDEM-1 testing. The two-zone model is found to be an improvement on BREDEM-1, there being less scatter in the results. Even so, the paper identifies potential areas for improvement.},

abstract = {In November 2016, the Paris Agreement entered into force calling Parties to strengthen their cooperation for enhancing adaptation and narrowing the gap between climate science and policy. Moreover, climate change has been identified as a central challenge for sustainable development by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Data provide the basis for a reliable scientific understanding and knowledge as well as the foundation for services that are required to take informed decisions. In consequence, there is an increasing need for translating the massive amount of climate data and information that already exists into customized tools, products and services to monitor the range of climate change impacts and their evolution. It is crucial that these data and information should be made available not in the way that they are collected, but in the way that they are being used by the largest audience possible.Considering that climate data is part of the broader Earth observation and geospatial data domain, the aim of this paper is to review the state-of-the-art geospatial technologies that can support the delivery of efficient and effective climate services, and enhancing the value chain of climate data in support of the objectives of the Global Framework for Climate Services. The major benefit of spatially-enabling climate services is that it brings interoperability along the entire climate data value chain. It facilitates storing, visualizing, accessing, processing/analyzing, and integrating climate data and information and enables users to create value-added products and services.},

@article{Connolly2014,
abstract = {Six different strategies have recently been proposed for the European Union (EU) energy system in the European Commission's report, Energy Roadmap 2050. The objective for these strategies is to identify how the EU can reach its target of an 80{\%} reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 compared to 1990 levels. None of these scenarios involve the large-scale implementation of district heating, but instead they focus on the electrification of the heating sector (primarily using heat pumps) and/or the large-scale implementation of electricity and heat savings. In this paper, the potential for district heating in the EU between now and 2050 is identified, based on extensive and detailed mapping of the EU heat demand and various supply options. Subsequently, a new ‘district heating plus heat savings' scenario is technically and economically assessed from an energy systems perspective. The results indicate that with district heating, the EU energy system will be able to achieve the same reductions in primary energy supply and carbon dioxide emissions as the existing alternatives proposed. However, with district heating these goals can be achieved at a lower cost, with heating and cooling costs reduced by approximately 15{\%}.},

The aims of this paper are fourfold: (a) to briefly describe bottom-up and top-down methods and overview common bottom-up modelling techniques (statistical and building physics based), (b) to critically analyse the existing bottom-up building physics based residential energy models focusing on their purposes, strengths, and shortcomings, (c) to compare five building physics based bottom-up models focusing on the same building stock – UK case study, and (d) to identify the next generation of coupled energy–health bottom-up building stock models. This paper has identified three major issues which need to be addressed: a) the lack of publicly available detailed data relating to inputs and assumptions, as well as underlying algorithms, renders any attempt to reproduce their outcomes problematic, b) lack of data on the relative importance of input parameter variations on the predicted demand outputs, and c) uncertainty as to the socio-technical drivers of energy consumption – how people use energy and how they react to changes in their home as a result of energy conservation measures.},

abstract = {Multiple regression modeling of monitored building energy use data is often faulted as a reliable means of predicting energy use on the grounds that multicollinearity between the regressor variables can lead both to improper interpretation of the relative importance of the various physical regressor parameters and to a model with unstable regressor coefficients. Principal component analysis (PCA) has the potential to overcome such drawbacks. While a few case studies have already attempted to apply this technique to building energy data, the objectives of this study were to make a broader evaluation of PCA and multiple regression analysis (MRA) and to establish guidelines under which one approach is preferable to the other. Four geographic locations in the US with different climatic conditions were selected and synthetic data sequences representative of daily energy use in large institutional buildings were generated in each location using a linear model with outdoor temperature, outdoor specific humidity and solar radiation as the three regression variables. MRA and PCA approaches were then applied to these data sets and their relative performances were compared. Conditions under which PCA seems to perform better than MRA were identified and preliminary recommendations on the use of either modeling approach formulated.},

abstract = {Concern has recently intensified regarding increases in the consumption of energy services that often follow energy efficiency improvements, a phenomenon widely called the 'rebound effect'. However, while some economists have precisely defined this as a metric, much discussion in academic and policy literature is imprecise, leading to confusion and miscommunication. This is especially so regarding direct 'rebound effects' in thermal retrofits of existing homes. This study surveys common usages of the term 'rebound effect' in domestic heating, identifying three main metrics, which employ different mathematical forms and therefore give different results, but are often lumped together. It defines these as the 'classic' rebound effect; the 'energy savings deficit', and the 'energy performance gap'. It then applies these to an empirical case study of three recently retrofitted 30-apartment buildings in Germany. It finds that each metric gives different results for identical situations, ranging from 2.0{\%} to 29.9{\%} for one building, 15.7{\%} to 56.8{\%} for the second, and 43.7{\%} to 272.9{\%} for the third. This may be one reason so-called 'rebound effect' results from various studies are so disparate. Nevertheless, specific uses are identified for each of the three metrics, provided their precise definitions are made clear. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The project consisted of three schemes, which were carried out in the early to mid 1990s and monitored over a 2-year period. Results indicate that modernisation schemes have a very important part to play in reducing CO2 emissions and that improvements in the region of 50{\%} can be achieved at modest cost using well proven (early 1980s) technology. The possibility of additional improvements are also identified which could see emissions fall by a further 30–40{\%}. In addition, the project identifies difficulties posed by, often small, variations in dwelling construction, which can have a disproportionate impact on costs, and by the design and use of mixed heating systems which can reduce overall heating efficiencies. The paper also discusses the impact of the demonstration project on the dissemination of good energy efficient practice within the Local Authority and highlights the lessons learned for implementation in future modernisation schemes.},

Moreover, to prevent excessively high normal incidence beam irradiances at very low solar elevations, the model does not allow a solar elevation dependent maximum beam transmittance to be exceeded. This new model is tuned to 32 years of data from Bergen, Norway. Moreover, a test against independent data from four European stations showed that the model performs better than the models of Erbs et al. (1982), Maxwell (1987) and Perez et al. (1992).},

The detailed physical models are the CTF (Conduction Transfer Function) models of building envelopes based on the easily available detailed physical properties of exterior walls and roof. The thermal network model is the 2R2C model, and its parameters are estimated and optimized using genetic algorithm with short-term monitored operation data. The parameter optimization of the simplified building internal mass model (2R2C) and the simplified dynamic building model (i.e., CTF+2R2C model) are validated in a high-rising commercial office building under various weather conditions.

abstract = {To understand the importance of and interaction between household and building characteristics in predicting domestic energy consumption, we analyse Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) along with a host of consumption drivers. Particularly, we exploit a large sample of English dwellings drawn from the National Energy Efficiency Database (NEED) to show that property type, age, size and the main fuel used for heating play an important role in explaining the variation in gas and total energy consumption. Energy efficiency improvements including loft insulation, cavity wall insulation and new efficient boiler installation are also found to be associated with lower gas and total energy consumption. Additionally, the regression results from this sample suggest that socioeconomic characteristics in the form of deprivation at local area level have a significant bearing on gas and energy consumption of dwellings. In the second sample, observations from the English Housing Survey are used to incorporate socio-economic characteristics at household level, energy prices and weather conditions into the analysis. We find households` composition, income, age and employment status to be important drivers of gas used for space heating which is also found to vary with gas prices and meteorological observations in the form of heating degree days. More importantly, the EPC rating of a dwelling is documented to be a powerful predictor of consumption level. Particularly, favourable EPC rated properties are associated with lower consumption levels, suggesting that the energy performance expressed by the EPC translates into savings on fuel costs in terms of lower energy consumption.},

abstract = {We present measured annual performance data from a dozen recent-vintage very low energy homes in North America. Many of the designs combine greater energy efficiency with solar electric photovoltaic power in an attempt to create Zero Energy Homes (ZEH). We also provide measured data from the first home constructed to the German Passivhaus standard in the United States. Several projects either exceeded or come very close to true net zero energy when evaluated over a year. The data indicate that very low energy use buildings can very readily be achieved in North America. Annual energy use half that or less than standard housing can be achieved for an equivalent cost of {\$}0.10/kWh from the efficiency investment. In general, the better cost effectiveness seen from energy efficiency measures indicates that greater investment in conservation should be a prerequisite to installation of solar water heating and solar electricity in Zero Energy Homes. However, over emphasis in efficiency is also possible. This suggests that optimization tools such as BEopt and EGUSA, which characterize both renewable resource performance and that also of specific combinations of energy efficiency measures, will best guide designers to locate the most economically favorable mix to reach an energy neutral level.},

These shifts are determined by the outcome of an unobserved two-state indicator variable that follows a Markov process with unknown transition probabilities. A Bayesian framework is developed in which the unobserved states, one for each time point, are treated as missing data and then analyzed via the simulation tool of Gibbs sampling. This method is expedient because the conditional posterior distribution of the parameters, given the states, and the conditional posterior distribution of the states, given the parameters, all have a form amenable to Monte Carlo sampling. The approach is straightforward and generates marginal posterior distributions for all parameters of interest. Posterior distributions of the states, future observations, and the residuals, averaged over the parameter space are also obtained.

The research sets out to determine whether householders believe these buildings are thermally comfortable, and if they feel confident operating the smart technologies that help achieve the net zero energy outcome? Combining interviews from 25 households and monitored energy data from over 50 near zero energy homes, this paper examines the validity of this policy goal from the building user perspective. The evidence shows households attain high levels of thermal comfort, enjoy lower energy bills, and believe their behaviour has been influenced by the building and its energy systems. Yet many remain concerned that the building industry is unable to produce homes that maintain thermal comfort in all spaces and all seasons. The residents have also identified significant issues in the reliability and usability of the energy technologies. Whilst the policy appears valid from the end-user perspective, the case study highlights the substantial task ahead for policy makers to establish suitable commissioning and compliance processes, and develop effective energy rating tools on the path to zero energy homes.},

These approaches are applicable to clinical trials designed to detect a regression slope of a given magnitude or to studies that test whether the slopes or intercepts of two independent regression lines differ by a given amount. The investigator may either specify the values of the independent (x) variable(s) of the regression line(s) or determine them observationally when the study is performed. In the latter case, the investigator must estimate the standard deviation(s) of the independent variable(s). This study gives examples using this method for both experimental and observational study designs. Cohen's method of power calculations for multiple linear regression models is also discussed and contrasted with the methods of this study. We have posted a computer program to perform these and other sample size calculations on the Internet (see http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/prevmed/psintro+ ++.htm).

@inproceedings{Schneider2016,
abstract = {One of the strategies for decarbonizing the energy mix is to increase the use of district heat networks, for distribution of waste heat or heat produced by renewable energy sources. However, planning such networks needs a geo-dependent energy database concerning demand and supply, incorporating their dependency on space and time. The present paper concerns the development of a bottom up statistical extrapolation model for estimating the heat demand of the Swiss building stock. The database is constructed on top of the Swiss building register, which contains basic data on building category, age, ground area and number of floors, as well as area devoted to dwellings. The model itself concerns: (i) estimation of the heated area of each building; (ii) estimation of the heat demand of each building, with disaggregation in terms of space heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW). The model is calibrated by way of recorded data concerning actual yearly energy consumption of around 27'000 buildings, with a classification by building category and age. The disaggregation in terms of SH and DHW allows for climatic correction of the observed data within a common climate basis. In a second step this calibration data is used for extrapolation of the demand on the entire Swiss building stock, for which the SH component is corrected by taking into account local climate characteristics. Finally, statistical methods tend to quantify the uncertainty inherent to the use of average demand values by age and category, in relation to the level of spatial aggregation.},

abstract = {Decentralized energy systems are increasingly seen as a key factor for a transition towards a low-car- bon, renewable energy based society. Within the transition process, regional demand and supply of renewable energy carriers have to be aligned, while considering the envi- ronmental conditions of the region. This paper focuses on the energy demand from buildings, which makes up 35{\%} of the total energy demand. It presents an approach for aligning the regional supply potential of renewable en- ergy carriers with the dynamics of regional energy demand from buildings. The approach consists of two components. First, a dynamic model simulates regional energy demand from buildings taking into consideration envelope renova- tion, legislative standards, and adoption of heating tech- nologies. Second, the regional supply is estimated based on the technical maximum possible, taking into considera- tion competing uses and spatial limitations. We show a first application in the case of the energy regionWeiz-Gleisdorf, Austria, which aims to achieve CO2 neutrality and energy self-sufficiency by the year 2050. Our results show that in the year 2050 (i) energy demand from buildings will de- crease by 40–55{\%}, depending on envelope renovation rates and legislative standards; (ii) demand for the different re- newable energy carriers will be determined by the choice of heating technology; (iii) the demand for wood could be met from regional forest resources, as long as there are no additional demands for other purposes; (iv) the demand for biomass for district heating would require 5–10{\%} of the agricultural area to be used for the production of energy plants rather than food; and (v) in contrast to other forms of energy, the demand for electricity will remain constant or increase slightly over time. This demand could only be regionally met if significant areas of fa{\c{c}}ades or gardens are used for photovoltaic electricity production in addition to roofs. Overall we identified several issues related to spa- tial planning and a need for further research regarding the transition towards decentralized energy systems. First, if biomass for central district heating systems is to come from regional production, areas should be allocated for cultivat- ing energy crops used specifically to produce fuel. Second, if wood is used for district heating purposes, the extent to which the import of wood from neighboring regions would be a useful ecological solution must be evaluated; this would involve extending regional energy planning be- yond the typical jurisdictional boundarieswhile considering ecological issues.},

@article{Chwieduk2009,
abstract = {It is important to know how to design a building to meet seasonally varying energy needs. In high latitude countries in winter the demand for space heating is high and a building envelope should receive maximum incident solar energy. On the other hand, in summer, walls and roofs exposed to incident solar radiation usually require shading to avoid too much solar gain. Data on solar energy availability are crucial for good building design. However, it is important how the availability of solar radiation is determined. An important aim of the paper presented is to give some results of a comparative analysis of two basic sky models, isotropic: Hottel–Woertz–Liu–Jordan and anisotropic: the HDKR, Hay–Davies–Klucher–Reindl, to recommend one of these models for determination of solar energy availability on a building envelope and to formulate the energy balance of a building. Differences between results obtained from both models increase with the slope of exposed surfaces. The biggest differences (12–15{\%}) are evident for vertical south surfaces, especially in summer. The simplified isotropic sky model is not recommended for evaluation of solar radiation availability on the building envelope. Underestimation of solar gains can lead to the selection of an unsuitable concept and construction of a building and result in poor indoor thermal comfort, i.e. overheating of rooms in summer.},

@article{Jack2015,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with measuring the fabric thermal performance of houses. This is important because the evidence shows that predictions of performance, based upon a summation of expected elemental performance, are prone to significant inaccuracy and in-situ performance is invariably worse than expected the so-called performance gap . Accurate knowledge of the thermal performance of houses could cause a shift in the way that houses are built, retrofitted and managed. It would enable quality-assurance of newly-built and retrofitted houses, driving an improvement in the energy performance of the housing stock. The current barrier to achieving these benefits is that existing measurement methods are impractically invasive for use on a mass-scale. The aim of this research is to address this issue by developing non-invasive fabric thermal performance measurement methods for houses. The co-heating test is currently the most used method for measuring whole-house fabric thermal performance; it is used to measure the Heat Loss Coefficient (HLC) of a house, which is a measure of the rate of heat loss with units of Watts per degree Kelvin. It has been used extensively in a research context, but its more widespread use has been limited. This is due to a lack of confidence in the accuracy of its results and the test s invasiveness (the house must be vacant for two weeks during testing, which has so far been limited to the winter months, and testing cannot be carried out in newly-built houses for a period of approximately one year due to the drying out period). To build confidence in the results of co-heating testing, the precision with which test results can be reported was determined by the combination of a sensitivity analysis to quantify measurement errors, and an analysis of the reproducibility of the test. Reproducibility refers to the precision of a measurement when test results are obtained in different locations, with different operators and equipment. The analysis of the reproducibility of the test was based upon a direct comparison of seven co-heating tests carried out by different teams in a single building. This is the first such analysis and therefore provides a uniquely powerful analysis of the co-heating test. The reproducibility and sensitivity analyses showed that, provided best practise data collection and analysis methods are followed, the HLC measured by a co-heating test can be reported with an uncertainty of ±10{\%}. The sensitivity analysis identified solar heat gains as the largest source of measurement error in co-heating tests. In response, a new approach for co-heating data collection and analysis, called the facade solar gain estimation method, has been developed and successfully demonstrated. This method offers a clear advancement upon existing analysis methods, which were shown to be prone to inaccuracy due to inappropriate statistical assumptions. The facade method allowed co-heating tests to be carried out with accuracy during the summer months, which has not previously been considered feasible. The demonstration of the facade method included a direct comparison against other reported methods for estimating solar gains. The comparison was carried out for co-heating tests undertaken in three buildings, with testing taking place in different seasons (winter, summer, and spring or autumn) in each case. This comparison provides a unique analysis of the ability of the different solar gain estimation methods to return accurate measurements of a house s HLC in a wide variety of weather conditions. Building on these results, a testing method was developed: the Loughborough In-Use Heat Balance (LIUHB). The LIUHB is a non-invasive measurement method, designed and tested in this study, which can measure the HLC of a house with an accuracy of ±15{\%} while it is occupied and used as normal. Measurements of energy consumption and internal temperature are discreetly collected over a period of three weeks, and combined with data collected at a local weather station to inform an energy balance, from which the HLC is calculated. This low impact monitoring approach removes the barriers to fabric thermal performance testing on a mass scale. The LIUHB has been successfully demonstrated in several comparative trials versus a baseline measurement provided by the co-heating test. The trials have included the application of extreme examples of synthetic occupancy conditions, testing in an occupied house, and quantification of the effects of a retrofit. Subject to further validation, the LIUHB has the potential to deliver many of the benefits associated with mass-scale measurement and quality assurance of housing performance.},

abstract = {Since the last decades of the 19th century, technological advances have brought substantial improvements in the efficiency with which energy can be exploited to service human needs. That trend has been accompanied by an equally notable increase in energy consumption, which strongly correlates with socioeconomic development. Nonetheless, feasible gains in the efficiency and technology of energy use in towns and cities and in homes have the potential to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse-gas emissions, and to improve health, for example, through protection against temperature-related morbidity and mortality, and the alleviation of fuel poverty. A shift towards renewable energy production would also put increasing focus on cleaner energy carriers, especially electricity, but possibly also hydrogen, which would have benefits to urban air quality. In low-income countries, a vital priority remains the dissemination of affordable technology to alleviate the burdens of indoor air pollution and other health effects in individuals obliged to rely on biomass fuels for cooking and heating, as well as the improvement in access to electricity, which would have many benefits to health and wellbeing.},

Expressions are derived for the standard error of the fit, as a function of the independent variable, for the general nonlinear and linear fitting problems. Additionally, closed-form expressions are derived for some examples commonly encountered in the scientific and engineering fields, namely, ordinary polynomial and Gaussian fitting functions. These results have direct application to the assessment of antenna gain and system temperature characteristics, in addition to a broad range of problems in data analysis. The effects of the nature of the data and the choice of fitting function on the ability to accurately model the system under study are discussed, and some general rules are deduced to assist workers intent on maximizing the amount of information obtained from a given set of measurements.},

abstract = {The methodology to predict building energy consumption is increasingly important for building energy baseline model development and measurement and verification protocol (MVP). This paper presents support vector machines (SVM), a new neural network algorithm, to forecast building energy consumption in the tropical region. The objective of this paper is to examine the feasibility and applicability of SVM in building load forecasting area. Four commercial buildings in Singapore are selected randomly as case studies. Weather data including monthly mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature (T0), relative humidity (RH) and global solar radiation (GSR) are taken as three input features. Mean monthly landlord utility bills are collected for developing and testing models. In addition, the performance of SVM with respect to two parameters, C and ɛ, was explored using stepwise searching method based on radial-basis function (RBF) kernel. Finally, all prediction results are found to have coefficients of variance (CV) less than 3{\%} and percentage error ({\%}error) within 4{\%}.},

abstract = {Improving the detection of thermal insulation in buildings –which includes the development of models for heating and ventilation processes and fabric gain - could significantly increase building energy efficiency and substantially contribute to reductions in energy consumption and in the carbon footprints of domestic heating systems. Thermal insulation standards are now contractual obligations in new buildings, although poor energy efficiency is often a defining characteristic of buildings built before the introduction of those standards. Lighting, occupancy, set point temperature profiles, air conditioning and ventilation services all increase the complexity of measuring insulation efficiency. The identification of thermal insulation failure can help to reduce energy consumption in heating systems. Conventional methods can be greatly improved through the application of hybridized machine learning techniques to detect thermal insulation failures when a building is in operation. A three-step procedure is proposed in this paper that begins by considering the local building and heating system regulations as well as the specific features of the climate zone. Firstly, the dynamic thermal performance of different variables is specifically modelled, for each building type and climate zone. Secondly, Cooperative Maximum-Likelihood Hebbian Learning is used to extract the relevant features. Finally, neural projections and identification techniques are applied, in order to detect fluctuations in room temperatures and, in consequence, thermal insulation failures. The reliability of the proposed method is validated in three winter zone C cities in Spain. Although a great deal of further research remains to be done in this field, the proposed system is expected to outperform conventional methods described in Spanish building codes that are used to calculate energetic profiles in domestic and residential buildings.},

Apply "hybridised machine earning techniques" to detect thermal insulation failures during operation


Cooperative Maximum-Likelihood Hebbian Learning is used to extract relevant features
Neural projection and identification techniques


Validated in 3 cities in Spain


A GREAT DEAL OF FURTHER RESEARCH REMAINS TO BE DONE IN THIS FIELD :D (2009 :S)




Intro
----
input factors:
* Spain - 5 winter and 5 summer climate zones
* building orientation and layout
* materials etc
* dynamic performance


3 step processdure for testing and validating model:
1. dynamic thermal behaviour calc using HTB2 software, postprocess to get dataset
={\textgreater} not mad keen on "black box" software approach
2. Cooperative Maximum-Likelihood Hebbian Learning (CMLHL) - apparently developed in part by Corchado, ref MacDonald, Corchado, Fyfe 2004
3. Thermal insualtion failure when temp error over threshold (delta room temp and model temp)


Unsupervised learning analysis
--------------------------
CMLHL determines whether dataset is "sufficiently informative"
* is an "Exploratory Projection Pursuit" EPP method
* project onto basic vectors (graphical analogy of projecting 3D vector onto XY plane), find "interested" element by seeing how far out of Guassian they are




Use to inform feature selection




Modelling
--------
Neural Network - apply 2 layer

Method for detecting insuation failure
--------------------------------

abstract = {The very short-term load forecasting (VSTLF) problem is of particular interest for use in smart grid and automated demand response applications. An effective solution for VSTLF can facilitate real-time electricity deployment and improve its quality. In this paper, a novel approach to model the very short-term load of individual households based on context information and daily schedule pattern analysis is proposed. Several daily behavior pattern types were obtained by analyzing the time series of daily electricity consumption, and context features from various sources were collected and used to establish a rule set for use in anticipating the likely behavior pattern type of a specific day. Meanwhile, an electricity consumption volume prediction model was developed for each behavior pattern type to predict the load at a specific time point in a day. This study was concerned with solving the VSTLF for individual households in Taiwan. The proposed approach obtained an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.23{\%} and 2.44{\%} for forecasting individual household load and aggregation load 30-min ahead, respectively, which is more favorable than other methods.},

abstract = {In order to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate fuel poverty, the UK Government has outlined proposals for a “Green Deal” to help provide financing for the installation of cost-effective retrofit measures to the existing UK housing stock. However, the Green Deal proposals have the potential to generate financial risk, due to a possible overestimation of the energy savings arising from retrofit measures. This paper proposes a framework for handling the uncertainties associated with the prediction of these energy savings, as well as demonstrating how decisions can be made in the face of the uncertainties involved in the retrofit analysis of a housing stock. The proposed framework is applied to a case study set of dwellings and it is seen that a limited range of measures will be cost-effective under the Green Deal proposals for these dwellings; as a result, subsidies will be required if higher impact measures are to be considered viable. Finally, however, it is also seen that the monetary value of additional societal benefits, such as reduced carbon emissions and improved thermal comfort, is likely to more than outweigh the cost of any subsidies.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Thermostats control heating and cooling in homes - representing a major part of domestic energy use - yet, poor ergonomics of these devices has thwarted efforts to reduce energy consumption. Theoretically, programmable thermostats can reduce energy by 5-15{\%}, but in practice little to no savings compared to manual thermostats are found. Several studies have found that programmable thermostats are not installed properly, are generally misunderstood and have poor usability. After conducting a usability study of programmable thermostats, we reviewed several guidelines from ergonomics, general device usability, computer-human interfaces and building control sources. We analysed the characteristics of thermostats that enabled or hindered successfully completing tasks and in a timely manner. Subjects had higher success rates with thermostat displays with positive examples of guidelines, such as visibility of possible actions, consistency and standards, and feedback. We suggested other guidelines that seemed missing, such as navigation cues, clear hierarchy and simple decision paths. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: Our evaluation of a usability test of five residential programmable thermostats led to the development of a comprehensive set of specific guidelines for thermostat design including visibility of possible actions, consistency, standards, simple decision paths and clear hierarchy. Improving the usability of thermostats may facilitate energy savings.},

We rely on this event, account for the endogeneity of price and payment plan with consumption through a plan selection correction term, and find that the provision of information is associated with a decline in electricity consumption of 11–17{\%}. We find that the reduction is robust to different specifications, selection-bias correction methods and subsamples of the original data.

@article{Cayre2011,
abstract = {In France, bottom-up models of national space heating energy consumption aiming at orienting energy policies are mostly based on the same basic framework modelling, derived from the 1988 French thermal regulation, like this used for the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). However, empirical evidence suggests significant differences between observed consumptions and those calculated with such a basic model like EPC. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the factors that could explain these differences and especially the role of the daily management of space heating (temperature and ventilation rate) by occupants, which is standardised in this basic model. Based on an analysis of time-series (1998-2005) and cross-sectional data (2009 survey), we quantified the impact of this daily behaviour on energy consumption and implemented this “behavioural factor” in the EPC basic model. Our results suggest that this factor depends on the theoretical budget share of space heating, calculated as the income share dedicated to the theoretical space heating bill. Thus, this factor makes it possible to depict rebound effect as well as price and income elasticities. It is worth noting that the impact of this factor on energy consumption is comparable to the impact of average technical improvements. As our focus is on long-term modelling, implications for long-term policy decisions have been studied. Thus, simulations of French residential space heating demand have been carried out over the 2010-2030 period using 2 variants of the EPC basic model. Results show that standard calculations (basic model), even if calibrated, strongly overestimate space heating consumption in older housing as well as their energy savings potential. Therefore, using evaluations based on standard calculations that neglect behaviours may lead to a significant overestimation of the energy savings achievable in the residential sector.},

abstract = {Improving the efficiency and performance of the UK residential sector is now necessary for meeting future energy and climate change targets. Building performance evaluation and certification (BPEC) tools are vital for estimating and recommending cost effective improvements to building energy efficiency and lowering overall emissions. In the UK, building performance is estimated using the standard assessment procedure (SAP) for new dwellings and Reduced SAP (RdSAP) for existing dwellings. Using a systems based approach we show there are many opportunities for improving the effectiveness of BPEC tools. In particular, if the building stock is going to meet future energy and climate change targets the system driving building energy efficiency will need to become more efficient. In order to achieve this goal, building performance standards across Europe are compared highlighting the most effective strategies where they are found. It is shown that the large variance between estimated and actual energy performance from dwellings in the UK may be preventing the adoption of bottom-up energy efficiency measures. We show that despite popular belief, SAP and RdSAP do not estimate building energy efficiency but instead attempt to estimate the cost-effective performance of a building and thus create perverse incentives that may lead to additional CO2 emissions. In this regard, the SAP standard confounds cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and environmental performance giving an inadequate estimate of all three policy objectives. Important contributions for improving measurement, analysis, synthesis and certification of building performance characteristics are offered.},
annote = {Important to distinguish between cost effectiveness, energy efficiency, and CO2 reduction targets




Improving building efficiency is one of lowest cost ways to reduce CO2


Need comparison/evaluation system to make policy work and build the right incentives


BPEC strategy - building performance evaluation and certification


SAP is important, basis of policies like Warm Front and Green Deal




SAP is based on BREDEM but isn't quite the same. RdSAP in turn based on SAP.


Not certain than better SAP ratings have translated into home savings.


Be clear about what BREDEM, SAP, RdSAP actually measure:
BREDEM is a building physics model, ignoring behaviour
SAP uses BREDEM algorithms and ignores behaviour, but uses standardised inputs for climate, occupants, internal temp, energy price. RdSAP similar to SAP but uses standardised assumptions for missing data




EU EPBD regulations require each member state to have a performance measuring tool


Possible to compare them and see what's good
Need to make room for innovative tech otherwise is a barrier to adoption - if innovations can't improve rating then don't get used


Portugal and Denmark have looser frameworks - simpler for innovative systems, less accurate


2 basic methods - estimation from physical properties and measurement from consumption data
={\textgreater} Check out these measurement methods to see how they work!


estimation is good for proposing ways to improve performance. Also is standardised so can compare with other buildings.


measurement is easy and quick, recommendations directly relate to real savings. Is affected by occupant behaviour - harder to standardise
Harder to identify specific improvements


So interest in combining. Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Latvia allow choosing between them. But not actually combining mehtods.


Recast of EP ref72
requires nearly zero energy new build in 2020 (vs zero CO2 in uk - which can innefficiently use low carbon energy, controversial)


EPC
Standardised measure.
Help reduce information inbalence between buyer and seller, help people make good buying decisions.
- fix disparisty between market price and fair value ref 76, 2/3 of ppl would pay more for more efficient home ref77


aside: VAT on energy is 5{\%} while VAT on efficiency improvements is full rate


in UK EPC display compares to national avg, not super useful


EPBD includes requirement to recommend measures to improve EPC score


SAP - allows mix and match, ppl choose for lowest installation cost to improve short term SAP rating
- net Annual Cost would be better
SAP doesn't use this for calc, doesnt consider life expectancy of measures


SAP cost rating perverse because incentivses cost
effectiveness - SAP is measure of economic performance.


Renewable fuels like wood only contribute to SAP through price.


Since calc comes from price, different SAP calcs may vary just with market price changes.


No contribution from FITs
No contribution from solar hot water for central heating (only hot water counted)
={\textgreater} again, if we just measured fuel consumption, this would automatically be included


Better if cost was left out, just show kWh/m2, result in clear goal and metric for reducing energy use


EQ 1.1, 1.2 show Energy Cost Factor calculation




Environmental IMpact rating
* created to supplement SAP rating
* uses emission factors from fuels
* better CO2 performance measure
* don't measure building efficiency


RdSAP
-----
Designed for people with little knowledge of building or modelling in general


Tradeoff between simplicity, accuracy, comparability
={\textgreater} to make things comparable try to factor out differences between regions etc, but loose accuracy.




Conclusion
---------


SAP and BREDEM have never been robustly validated against a stat significant sample of UK dwellings
={\textgreater} CHM paper by same authors addresses this


Lack of physical units on SAP and EI ratings is missed opportunity to provide unambigous measure
EI is energy measure translated thru carbon, but low carbon source allows high energy use if low carbon, ignores fuel poverty and resource conservation


SAP and RdSAP conflate different and conflicting puposes - energy efficiency, CO2 reduction, cost-effectiveness...


={\textgreater} maybe better to redesign tools, split up concerns to effectively address each point

abstract = {There is a growing interest in reducing energy consumption and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy. The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method. Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of models reported in the literature.},
annote = {Overview of modelling methods from various countries, including top down and bottom up approaches.


Top down
---------
estimate total energy use and attribute energy consumption characteristics to housing sector.
Inputs are things like total energy consumption, GDP, prices, climate, house build/demolist rates, etc
Econometric models focused on price
Technological models focused on things like appliance ownership trends


Bottom up
---------
calculate energy consumption of houses or groups of houses and extrapolate to totals.
Inputs are things like building survey, meter readings, local weather, etc

abstract = {A simplified building simulation tool to evaluate energy demand and thermal indoor environment in the early stages of building design is presented. Simulation is performed based on few input data describing the building design, HVAC systems and control strategies. Hourly values for energy demand and indoor temperature are calculated based on hourly weather data. Calculation of the solar energy transmitted through windows takes into account the dependency of the total solar energy transmittances on the incidence angle, shades from far objects and shades from the window recess and overhangs. Several systems including heating, cooling, solar shading, venting, ventilation with heat recovery and variable insulation can be activated to control the indoor temperature and energy demand. Predicted percentages of dissatisfied occupants are calculated for a given time period to support decisions concerning the thermal indoor environment. The simplified building simulation tool gives reliable results compared to detailed tools and needs only few input data to perform a simulation. The tool is therefore useful for preliminary design tasks in the early design stages where rough estimates of the building design are given and rough estimates of energy use and thermal indoor environment are needed for decision support.},

abstract = {The UK Government's Department for Energy and Climate Change has been investigating the feasibility of developing a national energy efficiency data framework covering both domestic and non-domestic buildings. Working closely with the Energy Saving Trust and energy suppliers, the aim is to develop a data framework to monitor changes in energy efficiency, develop and evaluate programmes and improve information available to consumers. Key applications of the framework are to understand trends in built stock energy use, identify drivers and evaluate the success of different policies. For energy suppliers, it could identify what energy uses are growing, in which sectors and why. This would help with market segmentation and the design of products. For building professionals, it could supplement energy audits and modelling of end-use consumption with real data and support the generation of accurate and comprehensive benchmarks. This paper critically examines the results of the first phase of work to construct a national energy efficiency data-framework for the domestic sector focusing on two specific issues: (a) drivers of domestic energy consumption in terms of the physical nature of the dwellings and socio-economic characteristics of occupants and (b) the impact of energy efficiency measures on energy consumption.},
annote = {NEED datasource

Background
--------------


Swan and Ugursal 2009 - regression analysis widely used to examine customer billing data
Regress social and phyiscal characteristics of dwelling against consumption


Note various correlations - income etc. good place to check for sources and studies




Method
---------


managed tricky integration of several datasets
meter readings, with tweaks to deal with readings not 1yr or including correction for prev yr estimates


modeled data for socio-econ from Experian, using credit card data and stuff


info on efficiency measures from HEED db.
- details of energy installations
- for co2 and fuel
- 50{\%} uk homes


take random sampling of 27million records to keep things managable


data matched on central address DB w. 94{\%} success rate for elec, differnt for others


VALID consumption accepted by DECC to be elec readin 1 to 50000kWh, gas 1 to 73200kWh


gas data records 2005 and 2008, can investigate efficieny installations 2006 2007


nb cant consider DIY installations


need to consider inflation


Sociio economic data placed in groups and sub-groups. assuming this is whats available if you get NEED dataset


Results
--------


Various summary statistics
={\textgreater} this is main weakness of paper (not a big deal since its more about the dataset) - general summary statistics without really forming a narrative, some kind of exploration to put the stacks of figures in context. probably useful as a reference but makes for unenlightening reading.


purpose built flats are use least energy
={\textgreater} was going to write 'are most energy efficient' - important to make and keep in mind distinction between total energy use and energy efficiency. In broader context, there is some philosophy around energy efficiency or energy effectiveness - because what we seek in living places is comfort and quality of life, which is not an engineering goal. in a more analytic view we want certain energy services. so we could have some tension in interpretation - a particualr flat could be less energy efficient per sq meter but use less energy overall. if the flat provides good quality of life then this is desirable over the more energy efficient but most total consumption alternative.


newer buildings dont really consume less than old ones
={\textgreater} cross reference this with EHS data


Note - exclude properties over 250m2, 1{\%} of homes - they have the exact same oulier problems i had before. There would be value in developing a logical and reproducible set of rules for inclusion/exclusion, including an analysis of the outliers. We throw them out cus they fuck up the stats, but if we want a clear picture of the breakdown of total energy consumption we also need to know what impact the oddities have. As a parallel, imagine we ignored top 1{\%} when analysing incomes- the whole recent debate has been about precisely the ridiculous inequalities between top 1{\%} and the rest!




council housing has lowest consumption
={\textgreater} man i cant wrap my head around numbers drowned in text in this way. find or make some decent graphs/vis to get better feeling for situation


bungalows saved most from loft insulation, logically


conclusion
------------
Desciptive stats - maybe worth printing tables for easier study
general good confidence in reported values
multi year analysis gives confidence in results of efficiency measures installed},

abstract = {Among the surface radiation budget components that are needed to understand the climate of the Earth, the thermal atmospheric radiation component is the only one that is not measured routinely, so it must be estimated indirectly. The presence of clouds substantially hampers this task, supplementing the emission of water vapour and carbon dioxide in the lower atmosphere. The methods proposed to estimate thermal atmospheric radiation often rely on a cloudless sky model and a corrective term that takes into account the cloud contribution. Several models for estimating the thermal atmospheric radiation under cloudy conditions have been tested using measurements recorded in Granada (Spain) during a period of 2 years. The cloudless sky model provides estimation with an error of about 5 per cent, whereas the cloudy skies models, after some modifications, estimate thermal atmospheric radiation with an error of about 6 per cent. Our results show the convenience of a quadratic dependence on cloud amount for cloudy skies models. In addition to this, it seems convenient to use available information about the radiative properties of clouds to assign different cloud emittances for different types of clouds within each level, especially for middle level clouds.},

abstract = {The “Solar Complex of Plan-les-Ouates” is a traditional multifamily building with some commercial and administrative areas. It was designed to consume a minimum amount of thermal energy by combining several renewable energy systems (1400m2 of solar roof, buried pipe and exhausted air heat exchangers) with an optimised envelope and electrical equipment. Initially predicted to consume 160MJ/m2 per year of gas, a gas energy use index (per unit heated floor area) of 246MJ/m2 per year was measured. The energy analysis of the building, based on a 3-year period of monitoring, brought up the most relevant points that explain this difference: the real conditions of utilisation (such as the interior temperature) and the real performance of the complete technical system are not taken into account in the theoretical value. Both technical and economical aspects of the renewable energy systems were analysed in detail. An important lesson learned from this experiment is that the energy concept of buildings must be simple and consistent and the complexity of the technical installations must be carefully managed from the design-stage to the exploitation. Detailed monitoring of innovative low-energy buildings is recommended to understand the possible discrepancies between theoretical and real heat consumption and to improve the transfer of new energy technologies to large-scale real constructions.},

abstract = {In France, bottom-up models of national space heating energy consumption aiming at orienting energy policies are mostly based on the same basic framework modelling, derived from the 1988 French thermal regulation, like this used for the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). However, empirical evidence suggests significant differences between observed consumptions and those calculated with such a basic model like EPC. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the factors that could explain these differences and especially the role of the daily management of space heating (temperature and ventilation rate) by occupants, which is standardised in this basic model. Based on an analysis of time-series (1998-2005) and cross-sectional data (2009 survey), we quantified the impact of this daily behaviour on energy consumption and implemented this “behavioural factor” in the EPC basic model. Our results suggest that this factor depends on the theoretical budget share of space heating, calculated as the income share dedicated to the theoretical space heating bill. Thus, this factor makes it possible to depict rebound effect as well as price and income elasticities. It is worth noting that the impact of this factor on energy consumption is comparable to the impact of average technical improvements. As our focus is on long-term modelling, implications for long-term policy decisions have been studied. Thus, simulations of French residential space heating demand have been carried out over the 2010-2030 period using 2 variants of the EPC basic model. Results show that standard calculations (basic model), even if calibrated, strongly overestimate space heating consumption in older housing as well as their energy savings potential. Therefore, using evaluations based on standard calculations that neglect behaviours may lead to a significant overestimation of the energy savings achievable in the residential sector.},

@article{Galvin2014,
abstract = {Concern has recently intensified regarding increases in the consumption of energy services that often follow energy efficiency improvements, a phenomenon widely called the 'rebound effect'. However, while some economists have precisely defined this as a metric, much discussion in academic and policy literature is imprecise, leading to confusion and miscommunication. This is especially so regarding direct 'rebound effects' in thermal retrofits of existing homes. This study surveys common usages of the term 'rebound effect' in domestic heating, identifying three main metrics, which employ different mathematical forms and therefore give different results, but are often lumped together. It defines these as the 'classic' rebound effect; the 'energy savings deficit', and the 'energy performance gap'. It then applies these to an empirical case study of three recently retrofitted 30-apartment buildings in Germany. It finds that each metric gives different results for identical situations, ranging from 2.0{\%} to 29.9{\%} for one building, 15.7{\%} to 56.8{\%} for the second, and 43.7{\%} to 272.9{\%} for the third. This may be one reason so-called 'rebound effect' results from various studies are so disparate. Nevertheless, specific uses are identified for each of the three metrics, provided their precise definitions are made clear. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
